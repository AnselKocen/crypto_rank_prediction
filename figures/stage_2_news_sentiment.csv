While the asset’s technical indicators show the move may be overheating, the broader picture reveals a network gaining serious traction. With major upgrades rolling out and key partnerships forming, Mantle appears to be hitting its stride at just the right moment in Ethereum’s scaling race. Source: Coingecko Mantle Hits $2.95B Market Cap: Can It Overtake Top L2s? Mantle is a modular Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, built on Optimistic Rollups and integrated with EigenDA to enhance data availability and security. Since its mainnet launch in July 2023, Mantle has rolled out OP-Stack upgrades, including meta-transactions and fee optimizations, and launched the Mantle Ecofund, allocating $200 million for developer grants to drive DeFi, gaming, and AI innovation. As a utility and governance token, $MNT pays for transaction fees and on-chain voting and currently has a market cap of more than $2.953 billion . A flurry of partnerships and product launches has put Mantle Network squarely in the spotlight in the last few months. Since its February 2025 integration with Chainlink Scale , Mantle has operated live Data Feeds and Data Streams on mainnet, allowing decentralized oracle data at high throughput for smart contracts. Under the hood, Mantle’s technical architecture has made strides in both throughput and security. In March 2025, Mantle became the first major L2 to fully integrate EigenDA, expanding its data availability operators from just 10 to over 200 and slashing trust assumptions in favor of economic security. EigenDA is now the LARGEST alternative DA provider in the world (in TVL secured). Meet the new blueprint for scaling the next decade of crypto infrastructure.

We’re pleased to announce the launch of the Mantle Index Four (MI4) Fund—a new institutional-grade crypto product developed in partnership with @Mantle_Official and backed by a $400M anchor investment from Mantle Treasury.

Here are 5 key takeaways from… pic.twitter.com/xZ4HU1iX98 — Mantle (@Mantle_Official) August 4, 2025 On the incentives front, Mantle has kept users engaged with regular reward campaigns. June’s Yapperboard Challenge Phase 2 doled out 50,000 MNT in weekly Discord rewards, and July 8 kicked off the $1.2 million MNT Reward Booster Season 3 —locking MNT allows users to earn proportional shares of the prize pool through time-weighted snapshots. This spurred further on-chain activity, reflecting robust adoption: Q1 2025 recorded about 650,000 daily active users and over 30 million transactions, according to Mantle’s own progress review , showing a vibrant developer and user base. DeFi TVL stands at $233 million, up 2.4% in 24 hours, while bridging TVL exceeds $1.7 billion. As Mantle pushes toward its v2 roadmap with ZK proofs and expanded DA bridges, the coming months are expected to be another proving ground for this fast-moving Layer 2. Mantle Breaks Out Above $0.91, But Aggressive Sellers Return Near Session Highs $MNT has extended its upward streak on the back of sustained demand, pushing to a high of $0.9207 before retreating slightly. What’s interesting with this move is the shift in volume dynamics across the 1-hour footprint and how the price responded to it. During the early phase of the session, buy volume rose aggressively between $0.8650 and $0.8800 with supportive deltas in excess of 600K, which is indicative of committed spot and perpetual buyers lifting offers across multiple price levels. $MNT/USDT price chart, August 5 (Source: TradingView) This laid the groundwork for the impulsive move toward the $0.91 zone. However, the character changed in the final two candles. The volume footprint showed that while total traded volume exceeded 3.9 million in the last hour, delta flipped sharply negative to -1.07M. This goes beyond passive distribution; it was more of a direct selling into bids after a vertical rise. Such behavior often implies profit-taking or renewed supply entering the market, especially when it coincides with key round numbers like $0.9200. The 4-hour price chart backs up the strength of the rally, as $MNT pushed well above its 20, 50, and 100 SMAs, all now stacked in proper bullish order. The asset’s price has broken out of a falling structure and left behind a V-shaped recovery. That said, the RSI is approaching overheated territory, reading at 73.81, which historically warns of potential pause or pullback. The MACD remains supportive of trend continuation, with the lines widening and histogram building upwards, but it’s already extended. Momentum remains strong overall, but it’s worth noting the shift in effort versus result. Buyers had to expend more volume to push the price just a few cents higher toward the close. Unless fresh demand steps in above $0.9150, the risk of a local pullback grows. $MNT’s price may revisit the $0.8800–$0.8850 area again to test whether recent buyers are willing to reload. If they do, the way toward $0.94 remains open. If not, we could see today’s high as a temporary ceiling.

2025-08-05 17:25:11,49592981,1754414711,Liquid Staking: SEC’s Landmark Clarification Brings Immense Relief to DeFi,"BitcoinWorld Liquid Staking: SEC’s Landmark Clarification Brings Immense Relief to DeFi The crypto world is buzzing with significant news! The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has provided a much-anticipated clarification regarding liquid staking activities. This development, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, confirms that these activities are not considered securities under current regulations. This announcement brings immense clarity and potentially paves the way for greater innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What Exactly is Liquid Staking and Why Does This Matter? Many in the crypto community have eagerly awaited guidance on various aspects of digital assets. So, what is liquid staking , and why is the SEC’s statement so crucial? Liquid staking allows users to stake their cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) to support a blockchain network while still retaining a liquid token representing their staked assets. This liquid token can then be used in other DeFi protocols, offering flexibility and additional yield opportunities. Previously, uncertainty existed about whether these liquid staking tokens, or the activities themselves, might fall under securities laws. This ambiguity created a cloud of regulatory risk, hindering growth and participation. The SEC’s recent stance provides a welcome sigh of relief. The SEC’s Stance: A Breakthrough for Digital Asset Regulation? The U.S. SEC’s statement signifies a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation . By explicitly stating that liquid staking activities are not classified as securities, the commission offers a clearer framework. This move distinguishes liquid staking from other crypto offerings that the SEC has previously deemed securities, such as certain initial coin offerings (ICOs). This clarification suggests a more nuanced approach from the regulator, potentially indicating a willingness to understand and differentiate various blockchain-based activities. It empowers developers and users within the DeFi ecosystem to proceed with more confidence, reducing the fear of unforeseen legal challenges. This positive development could foster a new wave of innovation. Boosting DeFi Innovation and Blockchain Securities How will this clarification impact the broader landscape of DeFi innovation and the perception of blockchain securities ? The positive ripple effects are substantial across the industry. Increased Participation: More users might feel comfortable engaging in liquid staking protocols, knowing the regulatory uncertainty has lessened significantly. Enhanced Development: Developers can now build more robust and integrated DeFi applications that leverage liquid staking without the looming threat of being classified as unregistered securities. Market Confidence: This clarity could attract institutional investors who typically shy away from unregulated or ambiguous areas, potentially bringing more capital into the DeFi space. The distinction between liquid staking and traditional securities could set a precedent for future regulatory discussions concerning other decentralized protocols. This move is a crucial step towards fostering a more predictable environment for the digital asset economy. What Are the Next Steps for Crypto Enthusiasts and Developers? While this news is overwhelmingly positive, it is important to remember that the regulatory landscape is always evolving. What should crypto enthusiasts and developers consider moving forward? Stay Informed: Continue monitoring SEC statements and broader crypto regulations. Regulatory clarity can be incremental and subject to further interpretation. Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research on any liquid staking protocol or DeFi platform before participating. Understand the risks involved, including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility. Advocate for Clarity: Support initiatives that promote clear, sensible regulation for the digital asset space. This ongoing dialogue is crucial for sustainable growth and further DeFi innovation . This clarification on liquid staking is a significant step towards fostering a more predictable and innovative environment for decentralized finance. In conclusion, the U.S. SEC’s recent statement confirming that liquid staking activities are not classified as securities marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This announcement provides much-needed regulatory clarity, significantly reducing uncertainty for participants and paving the way for accelerated DeFi innovation . It reinforces the idea that not all digital asset activities fit neatly into existing regulatory boxes and encourages a more nuanced approach. As the crypto ecosystem continues to mature, such distinctions are vital for fostering growth and ensuring a robust, compliant future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is liquid staking? Liquid staking allows users to stake their cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) to secure a blockchain network while receiving a liquid token representing their staked assets. This liquid token can then be used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. 2. Why is the SEC’s clarification on liquid staking significant? The SEC’s statement confirms that liquid staking activities are not considered securities under current regulations. This provides crucial regulatory clarity, reducing uncertainty and fostering greater participation and innovation in the DeFi sector. 3. Does this mean all crypto activities are not securities? No, this clarification specifically applies to liquid staking activities. The SEC has previously deemed other crypto offerings, such as certain initial coin offerings (ICOs), as securities. Each crypto activity is assessed individually. 4. How does this impact DeFi projects? This clarity is highly beneficial for DeFi projects. It reduces regulatory risk for platforms offering liquid staking services, potentially attracting more users and institutional investment, and encouraging further development of integrated DeFi applications. 5. What should users consider before engaging in liquid staking? Users should always conduct thorough due diligence on any liquid staking protocol. Understand the specific risks involved, including smart contract vulnerabilities, potential impermanent loss, and overall market volatility, even with regulatory clarity.

A rounding bottom breakout puts $745 as key support and potential targets at $790 to $1,000. Institutional players like Nano Labs are adding BNB to treasuries, signaling rising corporate interest. Price Near Record Levels BNB changed hands at $760 at press time, with over $1 billion in 24-hour volume. Prices dipped slightly in a day and 9% over the past week. In the last 24 hours, BNB traded between $755 and $770. Its seven-day range was $735 to $833. The token is still only 12% below its record high of $858 (CoinGecko data), set on July 28, 2025. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel pointed out that BNB has outperformed most major altcoins during this market downturn. Many tokens have fallen 60–80% from their peaks, but BNB never slipped beyond 30%. That steadiness keeps it close to record levels while the broader crypto market remains shaky. $BNB is performing better than most other major coins.

2025-08-05 17:10:07,49592438,1754413807,"Top Trending Cryptos to Watch Today: Mantle, Cronos & Litecoin","Today's market spotlight shifts to three promising cryptocurrencies. Discover why Mantle , Cronos , and Litecoin are capturing attention and showing potential for significant growth. Peek into the factors driving their momentum and what makes them stand out in the crowded crypto space. Dive into the article to uncover the trends that could shape their future. Mantle (MNT): Recent Movement and Critical Price Levels Mantle experienced noticeable shifts over the past month and six months. The coin surged approximately 48% in one month, followed by a pronounced uptrend that faced a 27% pullback over a six-month period. Price action varied widely, marked by a steady weekly gain of about 4%, hinting at underlying momentum amidst broader volatility. Price levels largely remained confined within a range from $0.58 to $0.88, reflecting a market responding to dynamic changes and intermittent investor interest. Oscillators and momentum figures suggest shifts between bullish bursts and temporary corrections, showcasing a market that tests both upward and downward pressures. Current price levels anchor tightly between support and resistance boundaries. The coin trades in a defined band with immediate resistance at $1.01 and a secondary barrier at $1.31, while support sits near $0.42 and a lower cushion at $0.12. Price consistently finds footing at these support levels, facing pressure when approaching resistance. Bulls appear cautiously optimistic with a rising moving average recommendation near $0.93, though oscillators indicate some lingering hesitation. Trading within these levels suggests a strategy of buying on dips near support and considering scaled exits around $1.01, especially given recent momentum. The current lack of a clear trend calls for vigilant monitoring of these key boundary levels. Cronos: Month Surge and Bullish Pivot Amid Support and Resistance Levels Cronos experienced a remarkable 71.15% gain over the past month and a 36.48% rise in the last six months, showing impressive short-term increase and steady long-term progress. The coin’s price moved significantly in recent weeks, indicating heightened trader interest and swift market response. The notable one-month surge points to renewed confidence in the asset, while the six-month growth reflects underlying strength developed over time. These changes suggest that Cronos has been capitalizing on market opportunities, with rapid price action in the short run and consistent gains over a longer period. The current trading arena sits between $0.0956 and $0.1663, with immediate resistance around $0.1935 and firm support established at $0.0521. A secondary resistance appears at $0.2642, while another support level lies at zero. Technical indicators show a slight upward thrust with the Awesome Oscillator at 0.0174, though a nearly flat Momentum Indicator at -0.003 and a minor negative Oscillators Recommendation of -0.182 suggest mixed signals. A Relative Strength Index of 61.431 hints that buyers are active, yet caution is warranted as price action remains balanced. Traders might consider entering long positions near the support level, and a confirmed break above $0.1935 could ignite further bullish momentum.

2025-08-05 17:08:47,49592867,1754413727,Trump signs 11 trade deals ahead of new tariff rollout,"The U.S. government brought in $30 billion from tariffs in July, a new monthly record that pushes total tariff collections for 2025 past $152 billion. That’s a 261% increase from March’s $8.2 billion, when President Donald Trump’s latest round of global trade duties began kicking in, according to Treasury Department data . This revenue spike comes right before a fresh batch of tariff rate changes goes live on Thursday, August 7. They were originally scheduled to begin on August 1, but Trump’s team delayed them by a week to give the U.S. Customs and Border Protection more time to handle logistics. Since April, the monthly flow of tariff revenue has risen fast: $17.4 billion in April, $23.9 billion in May, then $28 billion in June, and now the biggest number yet. Trump signs 11 trade deals ahead of new tariff rollout Trump also signed new trade deals with major U.S. partners in the days before the updated tariffs take effect. Agreements were reached with Japan, the European Union, and South Korea, three of America’s top trade allies. So far, 11 of the country’s 15 biggest trading partners have signed on to new trade arrangements under Trump’s leadership. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the White House expects total tariff revenue could top $300 billion. That money comes from U.S. businesses, which pay duties on imports directly to the government. But those costs don’t stay there. Companies usually raise prices on everyday goods to make up the difference, meaning consumers pay the price in the end. Meanwhile, consumer debt is piling up fast. New numbers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit show that 3% of all U.S. consumer debt was at least 90 days late between April and June, the highest level since early 2020. That’s up from 2.8% in the first quarter, and the jump was mainly driven by student loans, where 12.9% of debt went seriously delinquent, the worst in 21 years of tracking. Consumer spending falls as delinquencies rise Consumer spending has dropped during the first six months of 2025. That’s before the newest round of tariffs even hits. And now, with high interest rates still in place and job growth slowing, American households are feeling more pressure. Joelle Scally, an economic policy adviser at the New York Fed, said in a press release, “This quarter’s flow of household debt into serious delinquency was mixed across debt types, with credit card and auto loans holding steady, student loans continuing to rise, and mortgages edging up slightly.” Overall household debt rose by $185 billion in Q2, bringing the total to $18.4 trillion. That’s a 30% increase from pre-pandemic levels, while the nation’s GDP has grown 38% during the same period. Even as Americans fall behind on payments, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that current delinquency levels “are not a problem.” He claimed that “essentially, you have a consumer that’s in good shape and is spending,” though “not at a rapid rate.” But other recent data show cracks in that narrative. Middle- and upper-income households are starting to miss payments on credit cards and auto loans, a trend that could threaten an economy increasingly powered by high-income spending. Mortgages, which make up the largest portion of household debt, are seeing a slight increase in late payments. But the biggest jump came from FHA loans, which usually go to first-time homebuyers and lower-income Americans. Delinquencies in that segment are rising faster than the rest. Researchers at the New York Fed pointed to tighter lending rules after the Global Financial Crisis as the reason mortgage credit quality has stayed strong. But they warned that risks are rising again as the housing market slows down following the pandemic-era price surge.

The order will reportedly penalize U.S. banks that refuse to work with Bitcoin, XRP, and other cryptocurrency companies, effectively ending years of discriminatory bank policies toward digital assets. A Direct Strike Against Banking Discrimination This executive order aims to halt what the White House calls “ideological financial censorship.” Banks that deny services to lawful crypto companies, allegedly based on political or risk-profile considerations, could face federal penalties. Institutions found guilty may be subject to hefty fines, regulatory action, and even criminal referrals, per emerging drafts of the order reviewed by credible outlets, including The Wall Street Journal. BREAKING: PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PENALIZE BANKS THAT REFUSE TO WORK WITH BITCOIN AND #XRP CRYPTO COMPANIES. NO MORE BANK BLOCKADES. CRYPTO IS HERE TO STAY. pic.twitter.com/LCjJHqXMow — RIPPLE Eagle eye (@Ripple_Eagleeye) August 5, 2025 Trump’s decision is reportedly motivated partly by claims that banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America closed or restricted accounts tied to him and his supporters. However, the implications extend well beyond politics, impacting how banks treat an entire industry. Crypto Firms Could Gain Full Banking Access For Bitcoin, XRP, and the broader digital asset ecosystem, this move could be a seismic shift in how the U.S. banking sector engages with crypto. If signed, the order would force major banks to provide basic financial services to compliant crypto businesses, opening the door to deeper institutional involvement, enhanced liquidity, and wider adoption. The banking blockade—often seen in the denial of accounts or payment processing—has long been a thorn in the side of crypto firms. This new policy would place the burden on banks to justify any refusal of service, thereby protecting the financial rights of digital asset companies. XRP Poised to Benefit Most Among digital assets, XRP could emerge as a top beneficiary. Its issuer, Ripple, has been at the forefront of pushing for regulatory clarity and banking access. Earlier this year, XRP was included in the U.S. federal government’s Strategic Crypto Reserve —alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano—under another Trump executive directive aimed at bolstering the U.S. role in global digital finance. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , a vocal advocate for XRP’s utility in cross-border finance, has also been credited with fostering deeper ties between Ripple and the current administration. With banking access restored, XRP’s real-world liquidity potential could finally be unlocked at scale. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Industry-Wide Impact and Market Optimism Market analysts say this could be the most crypto-positive move by any administration to date. Removing barriers between banks and crypto firms would boost investor confidence, draw in traditional financial players, and accelerate blockchain innovation. Some critics warn about the selective benefits of the order and whether it could unduly favor certain companies or tokens. Nonetheless, the industry at large views the move as a decisive step toward mainstream legitimacy. Final Thoughts RIPPLE Eagle Eye’s report appears consistent with official drafts under consideration. While the timeline for signing remains flexible, insiders suggest the order could be finalized within days. Once enacted, it will mark a historic shift in how the U.S. government views and treats cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and XRP. This executive order isn’t just political. It’s a financial revolution in the making. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-08-05 17:05:12,49592289,1754413512,The Perplexity Paradox: Why Defending AI Scraping Sparks a Crucial Web Crawling Debate,"BitcoinWorld The Perplexity Paradox: Why Defending AI Scraping Sparks a Crucial Web Crawling Debate In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where data is the new gold, a significant controversy has erupted, pitting web security giant Cloudflare against the AI search engine Perplexity. This isn’t just a technical dispute; it’s a fundamental debate about who controls access to information on the open web and how AI agents should behave. For anyone navigating the decentralized and data-intensive world of cryptocurrency, understanding the nuances of AI scraping and web access protocols is paramount, as it directly impacts the flow of information and the economic models of online platforms. Unpacking the Cloudflare Perplexity Clash The core of the recent dispute emerged when Cloudflare accused Perplexity of stealthily scraping websites, seemingly disregarding established blocking methods. Cloudflare’s test case was meticulously designed: a new website with a fresh domain, explicitly configured with a Robots.txt protocol file to block Perplexity’s known AI crawling bots. Despite these clear directives, when asked about the website’s content, Perplexity provided an answer. Cloudflare researchers discovered the AI search engine allegedly used a ‘generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS’ to bypass the blocks. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince did not mince words, posting his findings on X (formerly Twitter) and stating, ‘Some supposedly ‘reputable’ AI companies act more like North Korean hackers. Time to name, shame, and hard block them.’ This strong condemnation immediately ignited a heated debate across tech communities. The Core Debate: AI Agents vs. Traditional Web Crawling Perplexity’s defenders, particularly on platforms like X and Hacker News, quickly rallied, arguing that Cloudflare’s assessment was overly harsh. Their central argument hinges on a critical distinction: is an AI accessing a public website on behalf of its user equivalent to a human making the same request, or is it a bot? One Hacker News user articulated this by asking, ‘If I as a human request a website, then I should be shown the content, why would the LLM accessing the website on my behalf be in a different legal category as my Firefox web browser?’ Perplexity itself weighed in, initially denying the bots were theirs and calling Cloudflare’s blog post a ‘sales pitch.’ Later, Perplexity published its own blog post, claiming the behavior stemmed from a third-party service it occasionally uses. Their defense echoed their online supporters: ‘The difference between automated crawling and user-driven fetching isn’t just technical — it’s about who gets to access information on the open web.’ This argument highlights the evolving nature of web crawling . Traditionally, bots were either ‘good’ (like Googlebot, which indexed content to send traffic) or ‘bad’ (malicious scrapers, spammers). Websites used Robots.txt protocol and other security measures to differentiate and control access. However, the rise of sophisticated AI agents blurs these lines, posing a significant challenge to existing web governance. The Rising Tide of AI Scraping and its Implications The debate comes at a pivotal time when bot activity is reshaping the internet. According to Imperva’s recent ‘Bad Bot Report,’ bot activity now outstrips human activity online, with AI traffic accounting for over 50%. A significant portion of this is from large language models (LLMs) engaged in data collection. While not all AI traffic is malicious, the report also found that malicious bots make up 37% of all internet traffic, encompassing everything from persistent AI scraping to unauthorized login attempts. Historically, websites had a clear incentive to cooperate with ‘good’ bots like Googlebot, guiding them via Robots.txt protocol , because indexing led to traffic and potential revenue. Now, LLMs are increasingly ‘eating’ that traffic. Gartner predicts that search engine volume could drop by 25% by 2026. This shift creates a dilemma for website owners: Loss of Direct Traffic: If users get answers directly from AI agents, they might not click through to the original website, reducing ad revenue and engagement. Economic Disruption: Websites invest heavily in creating content. If AI agents consume this content without driving traffic back, the economic model for content creation becomes unsustainable. Data Control: Who owns the data and who has the right to access it for AI training or user-driven queries remains a contentious issue. Navigating the Future of Web Access: AI Agents and Beyond Cloudflare’s stance is that leading AI companies, such as OpenAI, follow best practices by respecting Robots.txt protocol and not attempting to evade network-level blocks. Matthew Prince specifically mentioned OpenAI’s use of ‘Web Bot Auth,’ a Cloudflare-supported open standard being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force. This standard aims to create a cryptographic method for identifying AI agent web requests, offering a potential solution to distinguish legitimate AI activity from malicious or unwanted scraping. The economic implications of this debate are profound. While humans currently tend to click website links from LLMs at the point they are most valuable (e.g., ready to transact), the widespread adoption of AI agents for tasks like booking travel or shopping could change this. Would websites inadvertently hurt their business interests by blocking these agents? The online debate captured this perfectly: ‘I WANT perplexity to visit any public content on my behalf when I give it a request/task!’ wrote one person. ‘What if the site owners don’t want it? they just want you [to] directly visit the home, see their stuff,’ argued another, highlighting the content creator’s perspective. ‘This is why I can’t see ‘agentic browsing’ really working — much harder problem than people think. Most website owners will just block,’ a third predicted, pointing to the practical challenges. This ongoing discussion between Cloudflare Perplexity , the broader tech community, and website owners underscores a fundamental tension: the desire for open access to information versus the need for content creators to protect their intellectual property and economic models. As AI agents become more sophisticated and ubiquitous, the internet’s established norms for web crawling and data access are being challenged, demanding new protocols and a clearer understanding of digital ethics. A Pivotal Moment for Web Governance The Cloudflare-Perplexity incident is more than just a corporate spat; it’s a flashpoint in the broader evolution of the internet. It forces us to confront difficult questions about the nature of web access, the role of AI in information dissemination, and the economic viability of content creation in an AI-driven world. The resolution of this debate will likely shape how AI interacts with the web for years to come, impacting everything from search engines to personal AI assistants and the very fabric of online commerce. Finding a balance between innovation, open access, and fair compensation for content creators will be the crucial challenge ahead.

2025-08-05 17:04:26,49592217,1754413466,Ripple Research: Traditional Finance Invests $100B in Blockchain from 2020-2024,"Banks invested over $100B in blockchain infrastructure from 2020 to 2024. 65% of banks explore digital asset storage, focusing on stablecoins and tokenized RWAs. Emerging markets like UAE and India lead growth, outpacing US and Europe adoption. Traditional financial institutions have invested more than $100 billion in blockchain infrastructure between 2020 and 2024, according to a joint study by Ripple, CB Insights, and the UK Centre for Blockchain Technologies (UK CBT) titled “Banking on Digital Assets.” The report analyzed more than 10,000 blockchain deals and surveyed over 1,800 financial institution executives worldwide. According to the report, banks are increasing investments in digital assets despite regulatory uncertainty and market volatility. Between 2020 and 2024, banks participated in 345 blockchain-related deals. The greatest interest was in payment infrastructure, followed by cryptocurrency storage, tokenization, and currency transactions on the blockchain. Additionally, approximately 25% of investments targeted infrastructure supporting settlements and digital asset issuance. Over 90% of surveyed executives believe blockchain and digital assets will have a significant or massive impact on the financial sector by 2028. Among banking respondents, 65% are actively exploring digital asset storage options, with more than half citing stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as priorities. The report cites examples of new technology implementation such as HSBC's tokenized gold platform, Goldman Sachs' GS DAP blockchain settlement tool, and Japanese bank SBI’s developments in quantum-resistant digital currency. However, consumer digital assets are not a primary focus for most banks, with less than 20% of respondents saying they offer crypto trading or wallets for retail clients. The report emphasized that changes are more infrastructural than speculative. By investing in blockchain, banks aim to modernize international payments, optimize balance sheet management, and reduce reliance on legacy systems. Ripple indicates that “the tokenization of real assets is moving into the implementation phase.” While regulatory clarity is still lacking in many countries, more than two-thirds of surveyed banks expect to launch digital asset initiatives within the next three years. These include pilot projects with tokenized bonds and infrastructure for settlements using CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) and private stablecoins. Crypto market participants are investing in tokenized treasury products, with McKinsey estimating their potential at $2 trillion. Blockchain investment from traditional finance peaked after the FTX collapse in Q1 2024. The biggest growth has been seen in emerging markets, particularly the UAE, India, and Singapore, which are outpacing the US and Europe in adoption rates.

FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki emphasized in a press release that “criminals are relentless in their efforts to steal money from victims” while exploiting emerging technologies like crypto kiosks. Today, FinCEN issued a Notice urging financial institutions to be vigilant in identifying and reporting suspicious activity involving convertible virtual currency kiosks. https://t.co/5eHKcqP0oC pic.twitter.com/W6QJ8xNZOc — Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) (@FinCENnews) August 4, 2025 Elderly Victims Bear Disproportionate Impact as Losses Surge Tenfold The alert specifically centered on how scammers disproportionately target older adults through tech support scams, customer service impersonations, and bank impostor schemes using Bitcoin ATMs as payment portals. Federal Trade Commission data revealed that fraud losses surged from $12 million in 2020 to $114 million in 2023, with incomplete figures showing $66 million lost in the first half of 2024 alone. Source: Federal Trade Commission Victims over 60 account for more than two-thirds of all Bitcoin ATM fraud losses, with median losses reaching $10,000 per incident, according to FTC research. The agency described Bitcoin ATMs as a “payment portal for scammers” while noting that older adults are three times more likely than younger demographics to report losses. The Treasury notice comes as jurisdictions worldwide implement restrictions on cryptocurrency ATMs, including New Zealand’s complete ban and Australia’s enhanced monitoring requirements. U.S. states are pursuing various approaches, from daily transaction limits to licensing requirements for operators. Global Crackdown Intensifies as Fraud Losses Mount New Zealand implemented a comprehensive ban on cryptocurrency ATMs alongside a $5,000 cap on international cash transfers as part of sweeping Anti-Money Laundering reforms. New Zealand has unveiled a set of reforms, including a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and a $5,000 cap on international cash transfers. #ATMs #Crypto https://t.co/LrL9HTJVOq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 9, 2025 Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee cited in the report 157 crypto ATMs nationwide that police identified as major channels for drug money laundering. Similarly, Australia’s AUSTRAC introduced stricter rules , including tighter cash limits and enhanced monitoring for crypto ATM operators. Tasmania Police revealed that the top 15 crypto ATM users in the region lost a combined AUD 2.5 million to fraudsters, with AUD 592,000 deposited directly into cryptocurrency machines. Back in June, California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation fined Seattle-based Coinme $300,000 for violating daily transaction limits and failing to provide required disclosures. The penalty included $51,700 in restitution to an elderly California resident exploited through crypto scams. Additionally, that same month, Spokane, Washington, banned Bitcoin ATMs entirely , while other jurisdictions implemented licensing requirements and transaction monitoring. Elderly Americans have lost millions of dollars after being pressured by scammers into sending them money through Bitcoin ATMs #CryptoATMs #Fraud https://t.co/l4mvYADUGg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 28, 2025 Illinois has also mandated that cash-to-crypto conversions record destination addresses to help investigators track fraudsters. The state’s approach seeks to create audit trails, while criminals increasingly use obfuscation tools to cover tracks. Federal Legislation Targets Protection for Vulnerable Users Senator Dick Durbin introduced the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act , establishing $2,000 daily limits for new users and $10,000 limits over 14-day periods. The legislation requires operators to conduct detailed conversations for transactions exceeding $500 and provides refund rights when police reports are filed within 30 days. The bill places responsibility on ATM operators to monitor suspicious activity and intervene when transactions appear fraudulent. New users would face lower initial limits, while established customers could access higher transaction amounts after verification periods. I’m on the Senate floor announcing new legislation—my Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act—to help stop fraud at crypto ATMs. Watch. https://t.co/JZqjfYkhat — Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) February 25, 2025 Durbin, who is retiring in 2026 after decades of service, warned that “enough is enough” regarding senior citizens losing life savings to ATM scams. He noted that 30,000 crypto ATMs operate across the country, creating widespread vulnerability to fraud. The Federal Trade Commission identified common scam patterns, including government impersonation, fake tech support calls, and business impersonation schemes. Victims are typically instructed to withdraw cash and deposit it into Bitcoin ATMs, while scammers maintain phone contact to guide transactions. FinCEN’s notice urged financial institutions to identify red flag indicators and report suspicious activity involving cryptocurrency kiosks. The guidance emphasized that while kiosks provide legitimate consumer access to digital assets, inadequate Bank Secrecy Act compliance by operators exacerbates illicit activity risks. The Treasury warning coincides with growing institutional recognition that cryptocurrency ATMs require enhanced oversight to prevent exploitation while preserving legitimate access for consumers seeking digital asset services.

2025-08-05 17:00:55,49592127,1754413255,"Cold Wallet’s $270M Expansion Pushes It Among Top Trending Cryptos for 2025, with VeChain, Tron, and Algorand Close Behind","For many people, crypto is more than charts and profits. It’s about belief. A belief that one digital asset could change everything with the right move at the right time. Plenty chase that hope, but few projects ever build the momentum needed to spark real change. This list highlights the top trending cryptos for 2025 chosen for steady growth, strong fundamentals, and visible user activity. If you think timing and strategy still matter, this is where to start. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): A $0.00942 Entry and a Growing System Behind It In each bull run, certain projects become known as the early starters with the biggest outcomes. Cold Wallet (CWT) may be one of those names in the future. Right now, it’s still accessible. In presale stage 16, it is priced at $0.00942 per CWT, a figure that may feel small now but could look very different later. This isn’t a standard launch. Cold Wallet has already gained scale after acquiring Plus Wallet for $270 million, which brought in over 2 million users in under a year. That active base shows traction beyond theory. The platform also includes cashback on usage, a use-to-earn setup, a governance layer led by the community, and added privacy with zero-knowledge proof tech. What draws attention is the model and the progress. Cold Wallet speaks to those who still see value in starting small with purpose. If you’re tracking the top trending cryptos for 2025, CWT isn’t just a name to note. It’s a project already showing signs of movement. 2. VeChain (VET): Strong Progress Backed by Real-World Impact VeChain continues to prove itself with real-world use. Known for enterprise-level solutions in logistics, VeChain works with major companies like Walmart China and BMW. But more than the partnerships, it’s about putting ideas into action. Unlike many coins that shift with market trends, VET sticks to building useful tools. Its blockchain helps track carbon output, food quality, and other key supply data. These are industries that demand better transparency, and VeChain is helping meet that need. With ESG (environmental, social, and governance) goals now a big focus in global markets, the project’s relevance is growing fast. VET might not chase the spotlight, but that’s a positive for those thinking long term. Anyone looking into the top trending cryptos for 2025 with strong use cases and enterprise backing will likely find VeChain worth serious attention. 3. Algorand (ALGO): Technical Foundations Turn Into Market Signals Algorand has earned respect through solid technology, offering speed, scalability, and a green footprint. But recently, the pace has picked up. With more projects around real-world assets (RWAs), central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and even FIFA partnerships, ALGO is moving from background player to major contender. Its carbon-negative chain and flexible smart contracts attract both builders and institutions. Now, market sentiment is catching up. Algorand is starting to show up in talks about the next generation of major Layer 1 networks. For those who have been steadily watching or accumulating, this shift matters. ALGO clearly deserves its place among the top trending cryptos for 2025 as one to follow with patience and high expectations. 4. Tron (TRX): Data-Driven Ecosystem with Lasting Momentum Tron has handled its fair share of pushback, from market dips to mixed opinions. Still, it ranks among the most active chains globally. Its network runs stablecoins, dApps, and media platforms at large scale, keeping TRX highly relevant. Its founder, Justin Sun, often draws attention, but his role in keeping the network strong is hard to dismiss. Tron now handles more daily transactions than Ethereum. Its major role in the USDT space gives it a solid economic base that many rivals lack. TRX appeals to those focused on real metrics. If transaction counts and total value locked speak louder than social media hype, Tron clearly belongs among the top trending cryptos for 2025. More Than Just Coins, These Projects Show What’s Possible Not every crypto asset brings something meaningful to the table. But a few still do. Cold Wallet, with its low presale price and large user base, stands out. So do VeChain, Algorand, and Tron, each proving long-term value through real work, not just ideas. For people looking at the top crypto presales for 2025 , the real search is for belief. It’s not just about numbers or charts, it’s about finding projects with potential to make a difference. That’s what this list represents. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

2025-08-05 17:00:52,49592125,1754413252,"Ethereum Climbs, Dogecoin Slips, But BlockDAG’s Live Trading Feature & $0.0016 Entry Is The Bigger Win!","Not every price swing tells the full story. Ethereum (ETH) has climbed sharply, driven by ETF inflows and renewed whale activity. Dogecoin (DOGE), meanwhile, dropped hard following speculation about an AI-related tool. Both show volatility, but neither gives users much control in real time. BlockDAG, however, is taking a different route. With its fully interactive Trading Dashboard V4, users can actually simulate trades before the coin even hits public exchanges. As a result, BlockDAG (BDAG) is getting serious attention among new crypto coins in 2025, and not just for price speculation. It’s about giving people access to real features early, building familiarity and skill before the market opens. BlockDAG’s Trading Dashboard: Letting You Act Before the Listing Hits Many crypto presales rely solely on future promises. BlockDAG takes a more practical approach. Its latest update, Trading Dashboard V4, gives users a live preview of how trading will look post-launch. By using the access code TRADEBDAG, users can explore full BDAG/USD trading charts, follow real-time price moves, and place simulated buy or sell orders, all based on current presale dynamics. Unlike typical demo tools, this one reflects actual market behavior. Price shifts are live, the order book moves, and the interface mimics what buyers will experience on major exchanges after launch. It’s a test run with real insight, allowing people to build confidence and learn the platform. This sets BlockDAG apart from other new crypto coins in 2025, most of which offer no real tools during presale. The platform’s strong performance backs this up. BlockDAG has already raised $363 million, distributed over 24.7 billion BDAG, and is now in its 29th batch at a price of $0.0276. Early participants, who entered at just $0.0010, are now sitting on gains of more than 2,660%. For new entrants, a special $0.0016 offer is still available for a limited time, making it one of the rare chances to catch significant upside before broader listings begin. More importantly, BlockDAG isn’t just pushing coin sales. It’s preparing its user base for long-term participation and providing tools that can help them grow into experienced crypto traders. ETH Rally News: Institutional Buyers Drive 75% Price Surge Ethereum (ETH) has made headlines with a sharp rise in price over recent weeks. From late June to now, ETH has gained nearly 75%, climbing to about $3,740 with daily trading volume reaching $32.7 billion. One major driver is the massive inflow into Ethereum-based ETFs. Notably, a single day saw $452.8 million added to these funds, with BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH leading the way. In parallel, on-chain activity also shows signs of long-term growth. More than 170 large new ETH addresses, each holding at least 10,000 ETH, have been identified, a strong signal of accumulation. On-chain volume has also jumped 288% in just three weeks, recently topping $10 billion. All these signs point to strong institutional interest and continued confidence in Ethereum’s future performance. DOGE Price Crash: AI Tool Rumor Sparks Panic Selling Dogecoin (DOGE) faced a sudden and sharp decline recently, following rumors tied to a supposed AI-based deregulation tool. According to social media claims, an unverified system called the “DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool” was allegedly linked to a fictional government body and sparked confusion across the market. The result was dramatic: DOGE dropped over 40% in just 24 hours, falling to roughly $0.24 by July 26, 2025. This came after a previous 50% monthly gain, making the fall even more noticeable. No official confirmation has surfaced, and analysts are warning that the entire event was likely driven by speculation rather than solid news. It serves as a reminder of how quickly sentiment can change, especially in highly reactive communities like Dogecoin’s. Why BlockDAG Leads the Best New Crypto Coins of 2025 While price swings may grab the spotlight, long-term users often focus on functionality. Ethereum (ETH) is seeing strong support from major institutions, and Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to draw attention, but both rely heavily on outside forces to create momentum. BlockDAG offers something different, a working platform before the coin is even live. The Trading Dashboard V4 gives users a practical space to learn how BDAG will behave on the market. They can watch trends, place simulated trades, and better understand how to interact with the ecosystem. This approach turns buyers into active participants from day one, not just spectators hoping for a price pump. Among new crypto coins in 2025, few are offering this level of engagement ahead of launch. BlockDAG stands out not only for its early ROI potential but for the meaningful tools it puts in users’ hands right now. It shows that future-focused crypto isn’t just about speculation; it’s about being ready when the market opens.

At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) gets a lift from BitMine’s massive $3 billion buying spree, giving its price rally a fresh jolt of energy. And then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG) , which just rolled out its Trading Dashboard V4. Unlike other presales that offer nothing but numbers on a page, this one puts participants inside a live trading environment before launch. With order books, price charts, and market depth already active, BDAG feels closer to a listed asset than an early-stage project. FET Price Outlook Turns Negative After Key Support Break FET’s recent drop below $0.66 has put pressure on the chart, breaking out of a six-month triangle pattern and extending losses by more than 15% over the past week. Analysts now point to $0.56 and $0.49 as likely test zones if the decline continues. Some relief could still come from a long-term trendline dating back to 2022, which has acted as support in previous corrections. Wave analysis suggests this latest sell-off may be nearing its final stage, but holding above $0.60 is key. If that fails, deeper losses could set in before buyers return in force. Ethereum Price Rally Gains Steam on BitMine’s Aggressive Accumulation Ethereum is back in the spotlight after BitMine pushed its ETH holdings past $3 billion, buying over 208,000 additional coins to bring its total stash to 833,137 ETH. This aggressive accumulation helped ETH rally almost 6% to $3,730 before easing back to $3,654. Analysts suggest the next moves for ETH depend heavily on whether other large buyers keep following BitMine’s lead. Without that sustained demand, the current rally could stall near $3,940 resistance, leaving the $3,600–$3,300 range back in play. BlockDAG’s Trading Dashboard Brings Future-Day Trading to Presale Buyers BlockDAG is shaking up what a presale looks like with its newly launched Trading Dashboard V4, now live for all holders. The interface feels like a full exchange setup, complete with live BDAG/USD charts, order books that refresh in real time, market activity feeds, and active buy and sell panels that work 24/7. This means participants aren’t just watching numbers tick upward; they’re practicing the same actions they’ll take once BDAG lists publicly. With over $362.5 million already raised and 24.7 billion coins sold, the project is setting new records for early participation. The current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, but as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, anyone buying before August 11 can lock in a special $0.0016 price. Once the listing goes live at $0.05, that entry point offers a potential 3,025% return. Early supporters from Batch 1 have already seen 2,660% growth on their holdings, showing just how strong the climb has been. With the dashboard now letting people trade ahead of time, the transition to real market activity feels closer than ever. Missing this phase could mean losing one of the lowest-cost entries before BDAG moves toward its confirmed launch price. Which Coin Holds the Biggest Upside From Here? FET is still looking for a bottom, ETH’s rally is tied to big-money buyers, and other leading coins are swinging with the market’s mood. But BlockDAG is breaking the usual pattern. Its live trading dashboard, huge presale traction, and limited-time $0.0016 pricing are creating an opportunity few early-stage projects ever offer. With just days left before pricing climbs, those looking for exposure to BDAG’s 3,025% potential gains have a clear window to act before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release changes the game.

2025-08-05 17:00:12,49592061,1754413212,Russia Ukraine Truce: Crucial Talks Emerge on Trump’s Offer,"BitcoinWorld Russia Ukraine Truce: Crucial Talks Emerge on Trump’s Offer Significant geopolitical shifts are constantly reshaping our world, and recent reports suggest a potentially pivotal development in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. There is growing speculation about a possible Russia Ukraine truce , specifically an air truce, being considered by the Kremlin. This move is reportedly linked to an offer from former U.S. President Donald Trump, signaling a complex interplay of diplomacy and economic pressure. What’s Driving the Kremlin’s Consideration of a Kremlin Air Truce ? According to Walter Bloomberg on X, the Kremlin is reportedly weighing a potential air truce with Ukraine. This consideration is not just a diplomatic gesture; it is seen as a strategic effort to avoid the risk of secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions are punitive measures imposed by one country (like the U.S.) on entities from a third country that continue to do business with a sanctioned country. For Russia, facing an array of existing sanctions, the threat of additional restrictions is a significant concern, driving this potential move towards sanctions avoidance . Understanding the implications of these sanctions is crucial. They can severely impact a nation’s economy by limiting access to international financial systems and markets. Therefore, any opportunity for sanctions avoidance would be a high priority for Moscow. The Role of Donald Trump in a Potential Trump Peace Plan The reported offer from Donald Trump adds an intriguing layer to this developing situation. While the specifics of Trump’s proposal remain undisclosed, his history of engaging in high-stakes international negotiations is well-known. His involvement suggests a potential shift in the diplomatic landscape, aiming to de-escalate tensions. A Trump peace plan , even if limited to an air truce, could be a stepping stone towards broader discussions. This situation highlights the complex nature of international diplomacy, where external actors can play a significant role in influencing the trajectory of conflicts. Trump’s potential return to the political arena might be prompting Moscow to consider preemptive diplomatic maneuvers. Could This Lead to Broader Ukraine Peace Talks ? While an air truce is a specific and limited form of de-escalation, its consideration could open doors for more comprehensive Ukraine peace talks . A successful air truce might build a modicum of trust between the warring parties, which is essential for any meaningful negotiation. Such a development could signify a shift from military confrontation to diplomatic engagement. Potential Benefits: Reduced civilian casualties from aerial attacks. A pathway to broader ceasefire agreements. Easing of humanitarian crises in affected regions. Key Challenges: Establishing mutual trust and verifiable compliance. Addressing underlying political and territorial disputes. Navigating the complex interests of various international stakeholders. The prospect of a Russia Ukraine truce , even a limited one, carries immense weight for regional stability and global security. It represents a potential moment where diplomatic efforts could gain traction, offering a glimmer of hope for a resolution to the prolonged conflict. The Geopolitical Implications of a Potential Russia Ukraine Truce The contemplation of an air truce by the Kremlin, particularly one linked to a Trump peace plan , underscores the ongoing geopolitical pressures. The international community is keenly observing these developments, understanding that any de-escalation, however minor, could have far-reaching consequences. This potential move is a testament to the effectiveness of international pressure and the desire for sanctions avoidance , even as the conflict continues. In conclusion, the reported consideration of an air truce by Russia, spurred by Donald Trump’s offer and the threat of secondary sanctions, marks a significant moment. While the path to a full resolution remains challenging, this potential Kremlin air truce could serve as a crucial test of diplomatic will and a fragile step towards a more peaceful future. The world watches closely for what this might mean for the future of Ukraine peace talks and regional stability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the reported air truce offer? A1: According to Walter Bloomberg on X, Russia is reportedly considering an air truce with Ukraine as a concession related to an offer from Donald Trump, primarily to avoid secondary sanctions. Q2: Who is Walter Bloomberg? A2: Walter Bloomberg is a prominent financial news reporter and analyst, often sharing breaking news and market insights on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Q3: Why would Russia consider this offer? A3: Russia is reportedly considering the offer to mitigate the risk of additional secondary sanctions, which could further damage its economy and international standing. Q4: What role does Donald Trump play in this situation? A4: Donald Trump is reported to have made an offer that is influencing the Kremlin’s consideration of the air truce, suggesting his potential role as a mediator or influencer in future peace efforts. Q5: What are “secondary sanctions”? A5: Secondary sanctions are penalties imposed by one country (e.g., the U.S.) on entities from third countries that continue to conduct business with a primary sanctioned country, aiming to broaden the impact of the sanctions. Q6: Could this lead to broader Ukraine peace talks? A6: While an air truce is limited, it could potentially build confidence and create an environment conducive to more comprehensive Ukraine peace talks in the future, although significant challenges remain.

2025-08-05 17:00:11,49592079,1754413211,Shiba Inu Team Member Reveals ‘Primary Challenge’ And ‘Top Priority’ Amid Market Uncertainty,"In the face of growing market uncertainty, a Shiba Inu developer, Kaal Dhairya, has spoken out on X about the project’s internal problem and the team’s top priorities. As SHIB begins August with a market dip, slipping further down the crypto rankings, and facing growing competition, Dhairya is drawing attention to the internal struggles holding the ecosystem back. Shiba Inu Primary Challenge Revealed According to Kaal Dhairya, the biggest issue holding Shiba Inu back is not the market, but what’s happening inside the community, highlighting the ongoing splits slowing down SHIB’s development and holding back its progress. He says rather than evaluating projects based on their potential benefits to Shibarium and SHIB holders, decision-makers often base their choices on personal opinions and bias. Related Reading: Spot Ethereum ETFs Set A New Record In July With $5.4 Billion Monthly Inflow Dhairya gave a past example to show how things used to be different. He mentioned how the K9 project thrived under the support and guidance of trusted community members like himself and another developer, Shytoshi Kusama. Back then, no one saw it as a scam or a quick cash grab, and the community supported it. But now, he says, even legitimate projects get caught in the crossfire of personal rivalries and distrust. Individuals who have already raised significant amounts of money from the SHIB community or built influence under changing identities often drive this tension. He added that while it is typical for projects to hire advisors or influencers to promote their tokens in return for payment, he believes the SHIB community should aim for something better. Dhairya emphasized the need for openness and honesty within the community regarding personal gains from promoting or advising a project as part of that higher standard. Top Priority: Building Unity And Community Governance With the market turning and the cryptocurrency dropping under the top 20 in the rankings, Dhairya clarified that the main priority now must be unity. Shiba Inu saw a 9% rise in July, but that momentum quickly faded. By early August, SHIB had dropped over 2%, falling from a high of $0.00001437 on July 28 to a low of $0.0000116 on August 2. The token has now dropped to the 22nd spot in the crypto rankings, with a market cap of $7.17 billion. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Reveals What Will Drive The XRP Price Value Instead of being divided by internal arguments, Dhairya wants the community to unite and tackle the external challenges, especially in light of SHIB’s recent price drop. These include rival projects that have pushed the cryptocurrency out of the top 10 and major web3 companies and crypto infrastructures that continue to overlook Shiba Inu. He also mentioned centralized exchanges that earn large profits from SHIB but do not show the community the respect it deserves. To face these outside forces, Dhairya stressed implementing practical decision-making tools, eliminating favoritism, and supporting projects that add actual value to the ecosystem. The developer also underscored the need to empower Shiba Inu’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as the future lies in building a fair, community-led system where every “Shibizen” has an equal voice. He further suggests a quad-token governance model and adherence to ethical guidelines, like the Great Canine Code, to keep leaders accountable and prevent misuse of power.

The crash comes just days after a controversial announcement from the Pi Network team, which may have intensified bearish sentiment across the community. PI Breaks Through Historical Lows As Downtrend Deepens The PI/USDT pair has now fallen beneath every key support level since its launch. As shown in the weekly chart, PI is trading under a sustained descending trendline and remains below all major Fibonacci resistance points. At the time of writing, the token is sitting just above $0.40, and price action is mounting with selling pressure to break lower, especially if broader altcoin dominance weakens further . This week’s candle marks a continuation of the steady decline that began in March, despite sporadic bullish spikes. This has allowed Pi to continue declining with every move and is now trading at its lowest price level since its launch. Interestingly, this crash came amidst a recent announcement by the Pi team. The Pi Network team published an announcement urging Pioneers to voluntarily lock up their PI tokens to boost their mining rates. According to the August 1 blog post, users can choose to lock up to 200% of their migrated balance and receive enhanced rewards for doing so. The post also explained the various ways to initiate the lockup via the Pi app and Pi Browser. Bleak Outlook Unless Strong Support Returns However, this move has done little to calm the storm, and Pi’s price continued its decline. The announcement’s timing may be flawed, particularly given the unaddressed concerns about migration delays and token liquidity. There’s the inability to trade or use much of the circulating supply, and now, locking tokens with no guaranteed future liquidity feels more like a sacrifice than a strategic decision. At the same time, liquidity is a major issue. There are limited trading options, as Pi is only available on a few centralized exchanges, but it’s not listed on major platforms like Binance or Coinbase. Also, there are a few mechanisms for real-world utility. Now that Pi is trading around $0.35, the downtrend has officially entered uncharted territory. Unless a strong support zone materializes quickly, Pi Network delivers a major ecosystem catalyst, or the inflow into the market returns, the current collapse may extend deeper. The lockup initiative, which was intended to encourage commitment and network growth, appears to have backfired among a user base already grappling with doubts about the project’s pace. As such, the Pi Network faces increasing pressure to deliver meaningful progress before the community’s confidence erodes even further. At the time of writing, Pi is trading at $0.352, down by 1.4% and 19.6% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.",Crypto News|Altcoin|binance|coinbase|Fibonacci Resistance level|pi|Pi Network|PIUSD|PIUSDT,EN,0,price pi network native token pi tumbled lowest level ever recorded breaking continuing retrace time writing crash come day controversial announcement pi network team may intensified bearish sentiment across community pi break historical low downtrend deepens pair fallen beneath every key support level since launch shown weekly chart pi trading sustained descending trendline remains major fibonacci resistance point time writing token sitting price action mounting selling pressure break lower especially broader altcoin dominance weakens week candle mark continuation steady decline began march despite sporadic bullish spike allowed pi continue declining every move trading lowest price level since launch interestingly crash came amidst recent announcement pi team pi network team published announcement urging pioneer voluntarily lock pi token boost mining rate according august blog post user choose lock migrated balance receive enhanced reward post also explained various way initiate lockup via pi app pi browser bleak outlook unless strong support return however move done little calm storm pi price continued decline announcement timing may flawed particularly given unaddressed concern migration delay token liquidity inability trade use much circulating supply locking token guaranteed future liquidity feel like sacrifice strategic decision time liquidity major issue limited trading option pi available centralized exchange listed major platform like binance coinbase also mechanism utility pi trading around downtrend officially entered uncharted territory unless strong support zone materializes quickly pi network delivers major ecosystem catalyst inflow market return current collapse may extend deeper lockup initiative intended encourage commitment network growth appears backfired among user base already grappling doubt project pace pi network face increasing pressure deliver meaningful progress community confidence erodes even time writing pi trading past hour seven day respectively,0.154,0.688,0.158,0.3617,1

Following in the footsteps of top institutional bull MicroStrategy (Strategy), Coinbase today announced a $2 billion convertible senior note offering for qualified institutional buyers. At this point, Coinbase announced plans to raise $2 billion through a special convertible bond offering to potentially purchase Bitcoin (BTC). If this happens, Coinbase would be the first company in the S&P 500 to purchase Bitcoin using funds from a bond offering. These bonds are being offered only to large institutional investors. The offering includes $1 billion of bonds due in 2029 and $1 billion of notes due in 2032. According to the statement, the bonds will be unsecured and will pay interest twice a year. The terms of the bonds' conversion into Coinbase shares and the final interest rate will be determined once pricing is finalized. Coinbase's $2 billion bond push comes at a busy time for crypto companies to use convertible bonds to raise money.

2025-08-05 16:57:37,49591954,1754413057,David Bailey Aims to Advance Bitcoin with $200 Million Political Action Committee,"David Bailey plans to raise up to $200M for a Bitcoin-focused political action committee. PAC priorities include abolishing Bitcoin capital gains tax and promoting crypto education. Experts caution regulatory and legal challenges in using company funds for political causes. US President Donald Trump’s Bitcoin advisor and Bitcoin Magazine CEO, David Bailey, has announced plans to raise up to $200 million to create a political action committee (PAC). The PAC’s main task will be to promote initiatives related to Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Bailey emphasized his intention to use Nakamoto Holdings, his investment company specializing in managing Bitcoin reserves, to implement the initiative. He stated that the goal of the committee is not only to influence the political agenda but also to “position Bitcoin for the long term.” Bailey named reaching the $10-million price tag as a priority and invited the community to propose additional ideas. These include abolishing the capital gains tax on Bitcoin sales, protecting the right to independently store cryptocurrency, and introducing “crypto education” in schools. Some experts added their initiatives. Alex Gladstein, director of strategy at the Human Rights Foundation, suggested seeking protections for open-source software developers and proposed allowing foreign countries to repay US debts in Bitcoin. Investor Tuur Demeester emphasized the need to return to a full-reserve banking system. At the same time, BTCS CEO Charles Allen cautioned Bailey against hasty moves, warning that using company funds for political causes could raise shareholder concerns and risk class action lawsuits. Bailey acknowledged the criticisms as valid but cited Coinbase’s support for Fairshake as an example showing that such practices are possible. He also stated that the effectiveness of the approach will depend on the size of the PAC and the level of industry support. Experts noted that creating such a committee requires appointing a treasurer, registering with the US Federal Election Commission, and regularly reporting expenditures.",News|Legal,EN,0,david bailey plan raise political action committee pac priority include abolishing bitcoin capital gain tax promoting crypto education expert caution regulatory legal challenge using company fund political cause u president donald trump bitcoin advisor bitcoin magazine ceo david bailey announced plan raise million create political action committee pac pac main task promote initiative related bitcoin first cryptocurrency bailey emphasized intention use nakamoto holding investment company specializing managing bitcoin reserve implement initiative stated goal committee influence political agenda also position bitcoin long bailey named reaching price tag priority invited community propose additional idea include abolishing capital gain tax bitcoin sale protecting right independently store cryptocurrency introducing crypto education school expert added initiative alex gladstein director strategy human right foundation suggested seeking protection software developer proposed allowing foreign country repay u debt bitcoin investor tuur demeester emphasized need return banking system time btcs ceo charles allen cautioned bailey hasty move warning using company fund political cause could raise shareholder concern risk class action lawsuit bailey acknowledged criticism valid cited coinbase support fairshake example showing practice possible also stated effectiveness approach depend size pac level industry support expert noted creating committee requires appointing treasurer registering u federal election commission regularly reporting expenditure,0.054,0.819,0.127,0.9169,1

Recently, a prominent voice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) underscored this very point, sparking an important conversation about our digital rights and the future of digital finance. Why is Financial Privacy So Important Now? The concept of financial privacy isn’t new, but its implications in the age of digital currencies are profound. For many, it’s about maintaining control over one’s own assets and transactions, free from undue surveillance or centralized control. This sentiment was strongly echoed by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce . Speaking at a recent blockchain conference in California, Commissioner Peirce emphasized the vital need for the U.S. to protect individual financial privacy. She argued that regulators, including the SEC, should actively embrace innovative blockchain technology that enhances privacy features and empowers individuals. Her stance highlights a growing recognition within regulatory circles of the unique challenges and opportunities presented by decentralized finance. Peirce’s advocacy for privacy-preserving technologies demonstrates a forward-thinking approach. She believes that enabling individuals to manage their own digital assets securely is not just a matter of convenience, but a fundamental right in a digital economy. This perspective challenges the traditional view that all financial transactions must be transparent to authorities, opening up a crucial dialogue. Embracing Digital Asset Self-Custody: A Path to Freedom? A key aspect of digital financial autonomy, as advocated by Commissioner Peirce, is the ability for individuals to maintain digital asset self-custody . This means holding your own cryptocurrency keys, rather than relying on a third-party exchange or custodian. It’s a foundational principle for many in the crypto community, offering a direct pathway to greater control and reduced counterparty risk. Self-custody empowers users, giving them direct ownership and responsibility for their funds. This contrasts sharply with traditional banking, where banks hold your money. In the crypto world, self-custody means you are your own bank. Katie Biber, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Paradigm, strongly supported Peirce’s perspective. Taking to X, Biber provocatively asked, “Do you want to live in a dystopia where developers are sent to prison for writing code that lets YOU have financial privacy ? I don’t.” Her powerful statement underscores the potential societal consequences if regulators stifle the development of privacy-enhancing tools. Protecting the right to develop such code is crucial for preserving fundamental freedoms in the digital realm. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Cryptocurrency Privacy? While the call for enhanced cryptocurrency privacy is clear, implementing it within existing regulatory frameworks presents significant challenges. Regulators often express concerns about illicit finance, money laundering, and tax evasion when discussing privacy-centric digital assets. Balancing these concerns with individual rights is a complex task that requires careful consideration. However, proponents argue that privacy and compliance are not mutually exclusive. Advancements in blockchain technology , such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), offer ways to verify transactions without revealing sensitive underlying data. This technological evolution could provide solutions that uphold both privacy and necessary regulatory oversight. Consider these important aspects in this ongoing debate: Regulatory Clarity: Establishing clear, adaptable guidelines for privacy-enhancing technologies is vital to foster innovation without compromising security. Technological Innovation: Encouraging the development of advanced tools that balance individual privacy with essential transparency for law enforcement. User Education: Informing the public about the benefits, risks, and best practices of different privacy approaches in digital finance. Global Harmonization: Working towards international standards for financial privacy in the digital asset space to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The path forward requires collaboration between policymakers, technologists, and the crypto community. It’s about finding smart solutions that respect individual liberties while addressing legitimate societal concerns. The ultimate goal is to build a digital financial system that is both secure and respects user privacy. The discourse initiated by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce regarding financial privacy and digital asset self-custody is a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry and individual liberties. It signals a potential shift towards recognizing and protecting fundamental rights in the digital age. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, fostering an environment where innovation thrives while safeguarding individual autonomy will be essential for the future of finance. The debate around cryptocurrency privacy will undoubtedly continue to shape how we interact with our money and data. Frequently Asked Questions What is financial privacy in the context of cryptocurrency? Financial privacy in cryptocurrency refers to an individual’s ability to control who can access their transaction data and holdings. It means having the option to conduct transactions without revealing personal identity or sensitive financial details to third parties, ensuring autonomy over one’s digital assets. Who is SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and what is her stance? Hester Peirce is a Commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), often dubbed “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance on digital assets. She advocates for protecting individual financial privacy and embracing technologies that enable self-custody of cryptocurrencies, promoting innovation while safeguarding user rights. What does “digital asset self-custody” mean? Digital asset self-custody means that an individual directly holds the private keys to their cryptocurrencies, giving them complete control over their funds. Unlike keeping assets on an exchange or with a third-party custodian, self-custody eliminates reliance on intermediaries, enhancing security and privacy. Why are regulators concerned about cryptocurrency privacy? Regulators often express concerns about cryptocurrency privacy due to potential misuse for illicit activities like money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. They seek to balance individual privacy rights with the need to maintain financial transparency and combat illegal operations within the financial system. How can blockchain technology help balance privacy and compliance? Advanced blockchain technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), can help balance privacy and compliance. ZKPs allow one party to prove that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself, enabling verification of transactions or identities without disclosing sensitive data to regulators.

In a speech in January, US President Donald Trump accused BofA of not doing business with conservatives. Said Trump, “Many conservatives complained that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America. They don’t take conservative business, and I don’t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what.” BofA CEO Brian Moynihan argues in a new interview with Face the Nation that the regulators are to blame, not his bank. “We have 70 million consumers and we’re one of the biggest small business lenders. So that’s not it. The issue they’re focused on is the regulators’ impact on this industry, and you heard Senator [Tim] Scott talk about this this week.

In this transaction, a wallet previously funded by Fidelity Custody moved 10,000 ETH and 4,978 ETH to Coinbase within a five-minute window, according to Arkham Intelligence data provided on August 5. Fidelity Ethereum transfer to Coinbase. Source: Arkham The transfers, valued at approximately $35.77 million and $17.8 million respectively, came just hours after the same wallet received a 6,000 ETH deposit from a Fidelity-linked address. This sequence of events has raised concerns that Fidelity or a related custodian may be preparing to liquidate a significant Ethereum position. Notably, the wallet involved in these transactions has been active over the past month, receiving inflows from major custodians and transferring assets to hot wallets associated with exchanges. The timing and size of the most recent transfers suggest institutional ETH movement, potentially ahead of market volatility or profit-taking. While no direct sale has been confirmed, the use of Coinbase deposit addresses implies a possible intent to sell. More funds are dumping Ethereum Interestingly, Fidelity isn’t the only investment manager offloading Ethereum. As reported by Finbold, BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF recorded its largest single-day outflow since launch on August 4, with 101,975 ETH, worth about $375 million, exiting the fund. The sudden outflow ended a 21-day streak of inflows and slashed the fund’s ETH holdings by roughly 3%, signaling a notable shift in institutional sentiment. As of press time, Ethereum was showing weakness, trading at $3,587, down over 3% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, ETH has dropped by 4%. ETH seven-day price chart.

Bonds convertible into shares or cash; investors can buy an extra $300M in notes. Following Q2 revenue decline, Coinbase shares dropped 15%, but analysts remain optimistic. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced plans to raise $2 billion through a private placement of convertible bonds. According to the company, the issue will be divided into two tranches, maturing in 2029 and 2032. Each tranche will have a volume of $1 billion, the press release states. Investors will also have the right to purchase an additional $300 million in notes across both tranches. Coinbase clarified that the bonds will be offered to institutional investors under Rule 144A, allowing a private placement exempt from SEC registration. The senior unsecured notes will be convertible into Class A shares, cash, or both, at Coinbase's discretion. The company intends to pay interest on these notes semi-annually. Coinbase also plans to enter into call option transactions to reduce potential share dilution from conversions, which they say will offset cash payments exceeding the principal amount of the notes. A portion of the funds raised will cover the costs of these options, with the remainder used for corporate purposes. These include working capital, capital expenditures, and repurchasing or redeeming other debt securities. The bond offering came shortly after Coinbase's Q2 2025 earnings report showed a decline in revenue and an increase in expenses. On this news, shares of Coinbase (ticker: COIN) fell 18%, according to Yahoo Finance. At the time of writing, Coinbase’s shares traded at $302.48, down 4.9% for the day, with a market capitalization of $79.2 billion.

2025-08-05 16:45:10,49591477,1754412310,EU AI Act: A Powerful Blueprint for Responsible AI Innovation,"BitcoinWorld EU AI Act: A Powerful Blueprint for Responsible AI Innovation In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where decentralized technologies like blockchain intersect with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, understanding regulatory shifts is paramount. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and innovators, the European Union’s landmark EU AI Act represents a significant development that could shape not only the future of AI but also its integration with Web3 ecosystems. Just as clear rules foster trust in digital assets, this comprehensive framework aims to create a predictable environment for AI, impacting everything from dApps utilizing AI to blockchain-based AI models. What is the EU AI Act? Described by the European Commission as “the world’s first comprehensive AI law,” the EU AI Act is progressively becoming a reality for the 450 million people across the 27 EU member countries. More than just a regional affair, this legislation holds global implications, applying to both local and foreign companies, whether they are providers or deployers of AI systems. For instance, it would apply equally to a developer creating a CV screening tool and to a bank purchasing that tool for its operations. This broad reach establishes a unified legal framework for AI use, aiming to harmonize practices across the continent and beyond. Why is AI Regulation Crucial for a Level Playing Field? The primary driver behind the AI regulation is to establish a uniform legal framework across all EU countries, preventing fragmented local restrictions on AI. This consistency is vital for ensuring the free movement of AI-based goods and services across borders. By creating a level playing field, the EU seeks to foster trust in AI technologies, which, in turn, can unlock significant opportunities for emerging companies and drive widespread adoption. However, this common framework is not without its demands. Despite the relatively early stage of widespread AI adoption in many sectors, the EU AI Act sets a high bar for ethical and societal considerations. According to European lawmakers, the framework’s main goal is to “promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy AI while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI systems in the Union, and to support innovation.” This ambitious statement highlights the delicate balance between: Promoting AI uptake versus preventing harm. Fostering innovation versus ensuring environmental protection. As with much EU legislation, the practical implications will largely depend on the specifics of how “human-centric” and “trustworthy” AI are defined and enforced. Fostering AI Innovation While Ensuring Safety To navigate the complex balance between preventing harm and harnessing the potential benefits of AI, the EU AI Act adopts a risk-based approach. This tiered system categorizes AI use cases based on their potential to cause harm, leading to differentiated regulatory obligations: Unacceptable Risk: A small number of AI use cases are outright banned due to their potential to violate fundamental rights. Examples include untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV for building databases. High Risk: This category includes AI systems used in critical areas such as healthcare, employment, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure. These systems face stringent regulations, including requirements for data quality, human oversight, transparency, and robustness. Limited Risk: AI systems that pose lower risks are subject to lighter obligations, primarily focused on transparency requirements, ensuring users are aware they are interacting with an AI. This nuanced approach aims to support responsible AI innovation by providing clear guidelines while mitigating potential societal risks. Decoding the Artificial Intelligence Law’s Implementation Timeline The rollout of this pivotal Artificial Intelligence law began on August 1, 2024, but its full implementation is staggered through a series of compliance deadlines. Generally, new market entrants face earlier compliance requirements than companies already offering AI products and services within the EU. The first significant deadline occurred on February 2, 2025, focusing on enforcing bans for prohibited AI uses, such as the untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for facial image databases. While many other provisions will follow, the majority of the Act’s requirements are expected to apply by mid-2026, barring any schedule changes. Understanding GPAI Models and Their Systemic Impact A crucial milestone in the EU AI Act ‘s implementation was August 2, 2025, when the Act began to apply to “general-purpose AI models with systemic risk” (GPAI models). GPAI models are defined as AI models trained on vast amounts of data, capable of performing a wide range of tasks. The “systemic risk” element arises from their broad applicability and potential for widespread impact, such as lowering barriers for chemical or biological weapons development, or unintended issues of control over autonomous GPAI models. Ahead of this deadline, the EU published guidelines for providers of GPAI models, encompassing both European and non-European players like Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI. However, existing market players with models already deployed have been granted a longer compliance window, until August 2, 2027, unlike new entrants. Does the EU AI Act Have Teeth? Penalties and Industry Response The EU AI Act comes with substantial penalties designed to be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive,” even for large global corporations. While specific details will be finalized by individual EU countries, the regulation sets clear thresholds based on the deemed risk level of the infringement: Prohibited AI Applications: Infringements can lead to the highest penalties, up to €35 million or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher. GPAI Model Providers: The European Commission can impose fines of up to €15 million or 3% of annual turnover on providers of GPAI models for non-compliance. The industry’s willingness to engage with the framework is partly indicated by the voluntary GPAI code of practice, which includes commitments like not training models on pirated content. In July 2025, Meta notably declined to sign this code, citing concerns about “overreach” and “legal uncertainties.” In contrast, Google confirmed its participation despite reservations, stating concerns that the Act might slow Europe’s AI development. Other significant signatories include Aleph Alpha, Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, IBM, Microsoft, and Mistral AI. However, signing does not always equate to full endorsement, as seen with Google’s qualified support. European companies have also voiced concerns. Arthur Mensch, CEO of French AI firm Mistral AI, joined other European CEOs in July 2025, signing an open letter urging Brussels to pause the implementation of key obligations for two years. Despite these lobbying efforts, the European Union affirmed its commitment to the established timeline, proceeding with the August 2, 2025, deadline as planned. A New Era for AI The EU AI Act marks a significant turning point in global AI governance. By establishing a comprehensive framework, it aims to foster responsible AI innovation , protect fundamental rights, and create a level playing field for companies worldwide. While the staggered implementation and industry concerns highlight the complexities of regulating a rapidly evolving technology, the Act’s ambitious goals underscore a commitment to human-centric and trustworthy AI. Its success will depend on continued collaboration between policymakers, industry, and civil society to navigate the intricate balance between technological advancement and societal well-being.

2025-08-05 16:40:10,49591320,1754412010,Altcoin Rallies: Why Experts Warn of Potentially Short-Lived Gains,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Rallies: Why Experts Warn of Potentially Short-Lived Gains The cryptocurrency world often buzzes with excitement, especially when it comes to alternative coins. Recently, we have observed a noticeable rise in retail interest in altcoins. However, amidst this enthusiasm, prominent analysts are sounding a note of caution regarding current altcoin rallies . They suggest that these surges may be short-lived, lacking the sustained capital and demand needed for long-term growth. Understanding Current Altcoin Rallies: What Analysts Are Saying Despite a surge in retail interest, as evidenced by Google Trends showing altcoin search interest surpassing Bitcoin in July, market experts remain wary. Analysts at firms like Bitfinex and Presto Labs, as reported by DL News, highlight a critical issue: these recent altcoin rallies often lack deep, sustained investment. This means the buying pressure might not be strong enough to support prolonged price increases. What does this imply for investors? It suggests that while altcoins might experience quick pumps, these movements could quickly reverse. The underlying demand simply isn’t robust enough to absorb selling pressure without significant price drops. Why the Altcoin Market Faces Headwinds? The current state of the altcoin market reveals a telling pattern. We see sharp price slumps following initial spikes, and Bitcoin continues to maintain its dominance. This combination signals that investors are exercising caution. They might be quick to take profits, preventing altcoins from establishing new, higher support levels. Several factors contribute to this cautious environment: Lack of Sustained Capital: Large institutional money, which can drive significant market movements, appears hesitant to flow into the broader altcoin space consistently. Weak Demand: Beyond speculative retail interest, there isn’t enough organic, utility-driven demand to sustain these rallies. Bitcoin’s Influence: When Bitcoin shows strength, it often draws capital away from altcoins, or its volatility can trigger broader market corrections that impact altcoins more severely. Navigating Volatile Crypto Market Trends For those navigating today’s crypto market trends , understanding these dynamics is crucial. Analysts suggest that major altcoin breakouts—those significant, lasting price increases—will likely remain rare in the near term. This outlook requires a more strategic approach to cryptocurrency investing. It is easy to get caught up in the excitement of rapid gains, but the data indicates a need for prudence. Investors should focus on long-term fundamentals rather than chasing fleeting pumps. This measured approach can help mitigate risks in a volatile environment. Strategic Digital Asset Analysis for Informed Decisions Given the analyst warnings, how can you make informed decisions in your cryptocurrency investing journey? Employing robust digital asset analysis is more important than ever. This involves looking beyond short-term price movements and understanding the true value proposition of an altcoin. Consider these actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Investigate the project’s technology, team, use case, and community support. Manage Risk: Allocate only what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio instead of putting all your capital into a single altcoin. Stay Updated: Follow reputable sources and expert analysis to understand broader market sentiment and fundamental shifts. In conclusion, while the allure of quick gains from altcoin rallies is strong, expert analysis points to a challenging environment for sustained growth. The lack of consistent capital and demand, coupled with Bitcoin’s continued dominance, paints a picture of caution. By understanding these dynamics and applying diligent digital asset analysis , investors can navigate the complex crypto market trends more effectively, making more informed choices in their cryptocurrency investing strategies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are altcoin rallies? A1: Altcoin rallies refer to periods when the prices of various cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin, experience significant and rapid increases in value. Q2: Why are analysts cautious about current altcoin rallies? A2: Analysts express caution because these rallies often lack sustained capital inflow and strong demand, leading to quick price slumps rather than long-term growth. Q3: How does Bitcoin dominance affect the altcoin market? A3: Bitcoin dominance indicates that a large portion of the total crypto market capitalization belongs to Bitcoin. High dominance can mean capital is flowing into Bitcoin, or that investor caution leads them to prefer Bitcoin’s stability over altcoins, thereby limiting altcoin growth. Q4: What should I do to navigate current crypto market trends? A4: Focus on thorough research, practice strong risk management, and stay informed about market fundamentals. Avoid chasing speculative pumps and prioritize long-term investment strategies. Q5: Is it still worthwhile for cryptocurrency investing in altcoins despite the warnings? A5: Yes, but with increased caution and strategic digital asset analysis. While major breakouts may be rare, carefully selected altcoins with strong fundamentals can still offer potential, but always be aware of the higher risks involved.

2025-08-05 16:39:00,49591684,1754411940,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) to Explode Again, But 2025 Brings Another Top Meme Coin to Watch","When it looked like the meme coin party was cooling off, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) stepped back into the spotlight. Both have shown clear signs of a comeback lately, and that’s turning heads in the crypto space. But here’s the twist: while SHIB and DOGE prepare for another run, 2025 may belong to a bold newcomer—LILPEPE, a meme coin with real utility and the potential to deliver over 12,000% gains before the year ends. Let’s unpack what’s happening. SHIB and DOGE Are Back In Action You’ve probably noticed the spark if you’ve been watching SHIB recently. The coin’s up over 60% in the past few weeks, and it’s not just hype driving it. A massive increase in SHIB burn rates—some reports say 16,000%+ in daily burns—has tightened supply, pushing the price upward fast. SHIB breaking past resistance around $0.000019 could open the door to a rally toward $0.000025, and analysts believe this move is still in play. The vibe in the SHIB community is picking up, too, especially now that token burns are accelerating, and large holders (whales) are moving SHIB off exchanges—typically a sign of holding for longer-term gains. According to this recent analysis , many crypto traders are eyeing a 40% pump in the coming weeks. DOGE, not to be outdone, is making its comeback. The coin’s price climbed above $0.17, and futures open interest has exploded—over 18 billion DOGE traded in just 24 hours, showing demand is flooding back in. Elon Musk’s subtle but powerful endorsement last week—“I like dogs and memes” and referring to DOGE as “the people’s crypto”—didn’t hurt either. It’s like a spark that lit the whole community back up. Some analysts now believe DOGE could revisit $0.36 and climb as high as $1.00 by the end of 2025. So yeah, SHIB and DOGE are alive, kicking, and ready to surprise us again. But Here’s the Meme Coin Everyone’s Whispering About: LILPEPE While SHIB and DOGE are the OGs of meme culture, LILPEPE is quickly becoming the most talked‑about meme coin of 2025. And for good reason. Built on an EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain, LILPEPE blends meme appeal with real infrastructure. Think ultra-low gas fees, high speeds, smart contract support, and everything DeFi-ready. But the presale performance is grabbing attention even more, and it’s crazy impressive. The presale is now in Stage 9, selling at $0.0018 per token. Over $14 million has already been raised from excited early supporters, with Stage 9 now more than 87% filled. Once Stage 10 opens, the price jumps again to $0.0019, and it’ll keep rising across the 15 stages until launch. Those who got in at Stage 1 have already seen their investment grow by 80%, and current Stage 9 buyers still stand to make a 66.6% gain by launch, when the token will list at $0.0030. Some experts say the potential is way beyond that—LILPEPE could soar to $0.10 or even $0.50 before the year ends. That’s more than a 12,000% return from current levels. No exaggeration. You can dive into the latest numbers here . It’s also officially listed on CoinMarketCap, giving it another layer of trust and visibility, just like SHIB and DOGE had during their early breakout runs. And don’t forget, LILPEPE is also running a $777,000 giveaway, where 10 winners will each walk away with $77K worth of tokens. All it takes is a minimum $100 contribution and a few simple community tasks. That kind of incentive has only added fuel to the already growing hype. The giveaway details are all on the official site’s giveaway page . Final Take SHIB and DOGE are back on track and could deliver solid returns over the next 12 months. But if you’re looking for that next-level opportunity, something that could be 100x or even 120x, LILPEPE is the one meme coin that could pull it off. With only a few days left in Stage 9 of the presale, now might be your last chance to get in before the next price jump. You can join the presale , explore what the project is building, or even try your luck in the massive $777K giveaway . Whatever you do, don’t sleep on LILPEPE. Because if it delivers even half of what analysts are projecting, 2025 could be a year to remember.

2025-08-05 16:35:11,49591108,1754411711,Google NotebookLM Revolutionizes Student Access to AI Education,"BitcoinWorld Google NotebookLM Revolutionizes Student Access to AI Education In an era where digital innovation reshapes every industry, from decentralized finance to educational methodologies, the integration of artificial intelligence into learning is becoming increasingly pivotal. For those tracking the rapid advancements in technology, particularly AI, the latest move by Google marks a significant shift in the AI education landscape. Google’s note-taking application, NotebookLM, previously accessible only to adults, is now opening its doors to a younger demographic, signaling a new frontier in how students engage with academic materials. Google NotebookLM Unlocks New Learning Potential Google’s commitment to expanding access to powerful AI tools is evident with the recent update to Google NotebookLM . This AI-powered note-taking and research assistant, once exclusive to users aged 18 and above, is now available to a much broader audience. Specifically, Google Workspace for Education users, regardless of age, can now leverage its capabilities, alongside general consumers aged 13 and up. This strategic expansion aims to provide younger students with sophisticated research and comprehension tools, directly addressing the evolving needs of modern education. The platform offers a suite of features designed to transform how students interact with their learning materials. Imagine converting extensive notes into engaging, podcast-like Audio Overviews , allowing for auditory learning on the go. Students can also visually summarize complex ideas using interactive Mind Maps , fostering a deeper understanding of interconnected concepts. Furthermore, the recently introduced Video Overviews feature enables users to convert notes, PDFs, and images into dynamic visual presentations, making study and revision more interactive and effective. These features are not just conveniences; they represent a fundamental shift towards more adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The Evolving Landscape of AI Education The move by Google highlights a broader trend: the intensifying competition and rapid innovation within the AI education sector. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, its potential applications in teaching and learning are expanding exponentially. Educational institutions and technology providers are recognizing the immense value AI can bring, from personalized tutoring and automated grading to advanced research assistance. This competitive environment pushes companies to develop more intuitive, powerful, and accessible AI solutions, ultimately benefiting students worldwide. The focus is shifting from basic digital tools to intelligent assistants that can genuinely enhance cognitive processes and academic outcomes. Empowering Students with AI Tools Providing AI tools for students is about more than just convenience; it’s about fostering critical thinking, research skills, and deeper comprehension. NotebookLM acts as a personal research assistant, helping students sift through vast amounts of information, synthesize key points, and organize their thoughts. For instance, a student researching a complex historical event can feed multiple articles, documents, and even lecture notes into NotebookLM. The AI can then help them identify recurring themes, generate summaries, and even suggest connections they might have missed. This capability is particularly beneficial for complex subjects, enabling students to grasp intricate details and overarching concepts more efficiently. It empowers them to move beyond rote memorization to true understanding and analytical engagement. Navigating Challenges in EdTech While the benefits of integrating AI into learning are clear, the expansion of such powerful platforms raises important questions, especially concerning data privacy and the potential for misuse. The EdTech sector, particularly with AI, faces scrutiny regarding how student data is handled and whether these tools might inadvertently facilitate academic dishonesty. Google is acutely aware of these concerns. For users under 18, NotebookLM enforces stricter content policies, designed to prevent the generation of inappropriate or harmful responses. Crucially, Google has stated that user chats and uploaded content are not reviewed by humans, nor are they used for training the underlying AI models. This commitment to privacy and responsible AI development is essential for building trust among students, parents, and educators, ensuring that these tools serve as aids rather than liabilities. Student AI Assistant: A Competitive Arena The availability of NotebookLM for younger users is not an isolated event; it’s a clear indicator of the burgeoning competition in the market for a dedicated student AI assistant . Google’s strategic move follows similar initiatives from other tech giants. Notably, OpenAI recently introduced a ‘study mode’ for ChatGPT, signaling its intent to capture a share of the educational market. This increasing rivalry among leading AI developers promises to accelerate innovation, leading to more diverse and sophisticated AI-powered learning solutions. For students, this competition means a wider array of choices, potentially more affordable access, and continually improving features designed to support their academic journeys. The ultimate winners in this competitive landscape will be those platforms that can best balance powerful functionality with robust privacy and ethical safeguards. Google’s decision to make NotebookLM accessible to younger students marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI in education. By providing advanced AI tools that facilitate research, comprehension, and organization, Google is not just enhancing learning; it is helping to shape the future of how students interact with knowledge. While challenges related to privacy and responsible use persist, the proactive measures taken by companies like Google indicate a commitment to developing AI solutions that are both powerful and secure. As the AI education space continues to heat up, students stand to gain immensely from these innovative assistants, transforming the learning experience for generations to come.

2025-08-05 16:31:52,49590783,1754411512,XRP Revs Up After a Clean Two-Legged Pullback as Ripple Joins Global Billion-Dollar Elite,"Will XRP Soar to $3.40? According to market analyst Lingrid, “XRP bounced from its rising support after completing a clean two-legged pullback, reclaiming bullish posture near the 2.70–2.80 zone. The consolidation phase is forming higher lows, suggesting accumulation within an ascending structure.” She added that if the trendline holds, XRP could break toward the $3.40 resistance, a decisive move above it may ignite the next bullish leg. Based on this analysis, Lingrid highlighted that XRP executed a clean two-step pullback, briefly dipping below trendline support before stabilizing between $2.70–$2.80. The rebound formed higher lows and reclaimed the uptrend, a classic accumulation behavior, with strong bids near channel support and resilience against breakdowns. Therefore, Maintaining support above the $2.70–$2.80 zone while forming higher lows may clear the way for XRP to challenge near‑term resistance at $3.40, which might ignite the fire towards the all-time high (ATH) of $3.65. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.98, according to CoinGecko data . Ripple Ranks Among World’s Top Private Companies According to the most recent CB Insights data, San Francisco‑based Ripple is now ranked as the 23rd most valuable private company globally, with a valuation of $15 billion. At the pinnacle of the list stands Elon Musk’s SpaceX, valued at about $350 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the world. Following closely are ByteDance, the parent of TikTok and OpenAI, each valued at $300 billion. Why the Ranking Is Significant First, appearing in CB Insights’ global top‑25 underscores Ripple’s transformational shift from a crypto startup to a mainstream fintech infrastructure provider. It now ranks alongside giants like SpaceX, ByteDance, and OpenAI. The presence of Ripple in this list highlights its role in redefining blockchain-based enterprise services, not just speculative token trading. Key Drivers Behind the $15B Valuation Regulatory Clarity from SEC Resolution Ripple exited its long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after securing a favorable settlement, clarifying that XRP isn’t a security in secondary sales. That ruling helped lift a major cloud of uncertainty around the company’s operations. Robust Institutional Adoption Ripple’s technology, built on the XRP Ledger and RippleNet, is now used by global financial institutions seeking faster and more transparent cross-border payments. This enterprise-first strategy enhances long-term value compared to retail-only crypto plays. Global Expansion & Infrastructure Development Ripple is expanding aggressively via partnerships in the Middle East and Europe. It’s pursuing a MiCA license in the EU, applying for a U.S. OCC trust bank charter to support tokenized asset issuance and its RLUSD stablecoin , and enhancing its developer ecosystem via RippleX. The Broader Implications Ripple’s inclusion as the 23rd most valuable private company sends a powerful signal that blockchain-based financial infrastructure can compete with traditional tech firms at scale. It also reflects a growing institutional trust in regulated, enterprise-grade crypto solutions. According to CBInsights, “A unicorn company, or unicorn startup, is a private company with a valuation over $1 billion. As of July 2025, there are over 1,200 unicorns around the world.” Conclusion Ripple's $15 billion valuation on CB Insights’ list marks a watershed moment not just for the company but for blockchain adoption in finance. With legal hurdles clearing, growing institutional traction, and an expanding global footprint, Ripple isn’t just riding the wave of crypto interest, it’s building the infrastructure of tokenized finance for the future, which might continue igniting XRP’s bullish momentum with the altcoin recently witnessing a two-legged pullback.",News|Ripple,EN,1,xrp soar according market analyst lingrid xrp bounced rising support completing clean pullback reclaiming bullish posture near zone consolidation phase forming higher low suggesting accumulation within ascending added trendline hold xrp could break toward resistance decisive move may ignite next bullish leg based analysis lingrid highlighted xrp executed clean pullback briefly dipping trendline support stabilizing rebound formed higher low reclaimed uptrend classic accumulation behavior strong bid near channel support resilience breakdown therefore maintaining support zone forming higher low may clear way xrp challenge resistance might ignite fire towards high ath time writing xrp trading according coingecko data ripple rank among world top private company according recent cb insight data san ripple ranked valuable private company globally valuation billion pinnacle list stand elon musk spacex valued billion making valuable private company world following closely bytedance parent tiktok openai valued billion ranking significant first appearing cb insight global underscore ripple transformational shift crypto startup mainstream fintech infrastructure provider rank alongside giant like spacex bytedance openai presence ripple list highlight role redefining enterprise service speculative token trading key driver behind valuation regulatory clarity sec resolution ripple exited legal battle security exchange commission sec securing favorable settlement clarifying xrp security secondary sale ruling helped lift major cloud uncertainty around company operation robust institutional adoption ripple technology built xrp ledger ripplenet used global financial institution seeking faster transparent payment strategy enhances value compared crypto play global expansion infrastructure development ripple expanding aggressively via partnership middle east europe pursuing mica license eu applying occ trust bank charter support tokenized asset issuance rlusd stablecoin enhancing developer ecosystem via ripplex broader implication ripple inclusion valuable private company sends powerful signal financial infrastructure compete traditional tech firm scale also reflects growing institutional trust regulated crypto solution according cbinsights unicorn company unicorn startup private company valuation billion july unicorn around conclusion ripple billion valuation cb insight list mark watershed moment company blockchain adoption finance legal hurdle clearing growing institutional traction expanding global footprint ripple riding wave crypto interest building infrastructure tokenized finance future might continue igniting xrp bullish momentum altcoin recently witnessing pullback,0.054,0.675,0.27,0.9978,1
2025-08-05 16:31:18,49590923,1754411478,Altseason on Hold? Altcoins Decline as Bitcoin Falls Below Local Support (Bitfinex),"Over the past three weeks, bitcoin (BTC) has been testing its local range lows near $115,800. Unfortunately, it gave way over the weekend, and the leading cryptocurrency fell to $112,000. Interestingly, altcoins followed suit, seemingly abandoning the bullish momentum they had ridden during this altseason. This raises the question of whether this decline is just a break in the altseason or the end altogether. Bitcoin Falls Below Local Support Bitcoin’s decline follows persistent market weakness amid aggressive speculative risk rotation toward ether (ETH) and other altcoins. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , the move signals a shift in market structure and rising downside vulnerability. The market’s current condition suggests that speculative appetite is declining across sectors, with cautious sentiment and elevated leverage. Before any catalysts can trigger strong directional momentum, there could be a period of reduced volatility and consolidation. This could be exacerbated as bitcoin’s loss of range support acts as resistance. Although BTC is struggling and may continue to do so in the meantime, altcoins are having it worse. Despite recent selling pressure, bitcoin’s market cap has remained above $2.2 trillion, accounting for almost double its 2021 cycle peak. ETH and the aggregate altcoin market, on the other hand, have failed to exceed their 2021 highs. This suggests that investors have remained cautious even while rotating their capital into high-beta and less mature assets. Is Altseason Dead? Worse still, altcoins performed worse than bitcoin last week. While BTC has fallen just 8.9% from its all-time high, ETH closed last week with a 9.7% plunge. The OTHERS index, which tracks the broader altcoin market aside the top ten, showed that this group of assets closed the week 11.5% in the red. ETH has plummeted 15% from its recent local peak, while the OTHER index is down 18.7% below its cycle high. Furthermore, the OTHERS index has shed roughly $59 billion in value over the last 11 days, reflecting rapid derisking among investors. “This contraction signals a clear waning of speculative appetite in the altcoin sector, which had seen a rapid expansion of open interest throughout July, even as BTC remained trapped within a tight trading range,” Bitfinex analysts stated. Meanwhile, only two large-cap assets are in the green over the last two trading weeks: ENA, the utility token of the synthetic dollar protocol, Ethena, and PENGU, the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) project, Pudgy Penguins. Although both assets are up 14.5% and 8.4%, respectively, they are also down from their all-time highs. The post Altseason on Hold?

2025-08-05 16:31:14,49590932,1754411474,Trump Expected to Sign Order Targeting Discrimination by Banks Against Crypto Firms,"White House to require probes into debanking of crypto firms and conservative groups. Trump may sign order before August 8, 2025, targeting bank discrimination practices. The order targets violations under credit, antitrust, and consumer protection laws. The White House will issue an order that will require financial regulators to investigate cases of debanking among crypto companies and conservative organizations, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing a draft of the order. The initiative is aimed at investigating violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws, and consumer financial protection laws. Counterparties caught violating these laws may face various disciplinary measures, including fines. The Wall Street Journal noted that US President Donald Trump may sign the order this week, before August 8, 2025. However, the publication also emphasized that the administration previously considered similar measures in June, but they were ultimately postponed. Combating crypto-related debanking is among Trump's campaign promises. He said he intends to end the so-called Choke Point 2.0 operation. The term refers to a series of measures taken under the Biden administration aimed at distancing crypto companies from the financial sector. Some experts and politicians believe this contributed to the closure of banks such as SVB, Signature, and Silvergate Capital. The order also aims to combat political debanking, particularly of conservative organizations. The document criticizes the role of financial institutions involved in actions taken following the January 2021 Capitol riots. The initiators were supporters of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, backed by Trump. In some cases, the order requires violations to be reported to the Attorney General. This requirement may indicate the possibility of more serious sanctions beyond administrative penalties.",News|Crypto,EN,1,white house require probe debanking crypto firm conservative group trump may sign order august targeting bank discrimination practice order target violation credit antitrust consumer protection law white house issue order require financial regulator investigate case debanking among crypto company conservative organization wall street journal report citing draft order initiative aimed investigating violation equal credit opportunity act antitrust law consumer financial protection law counterparties caught violating law may face various disciplinary measure including fine wall street journal noted u president donald trump may sign order week august however publication also emphasized administration previously considered similar measure june ultimately postponed combating debanking among trump campaign promise said intends end choke point operation term refers series measure taken biden administration aimed distancing crypto company financial sector expert politician believe contributed closure bank svb signature silvergate capital order also aim combat political debanking particularly conservative organization document criticizes role financial institution involved action taken following january capitol riot initiator supporter make america great maga movement backed trump case order requires violation reported attorney general requirement may indicate possibility serious sanction beyond administrative penalty,0.148,0.759,0.093,-0.9136,0
2025-08-05 16:30:33,49592192,1754411433,"Why Fair Access, Speed, and Clarity Shape the Spartans Model","In a space where unclear rules and limited access are still common, Spartans shows that fairness and function can work together. Built as a crypto-native sportsbook and casino, it is designed to remove confusion through clear terms, fast payments, and global reach. The goal is not to build hype or wait for future upgrades. Spartans already runs on three key areas that users care about: clarity, speed, and access. Whether betting on sports, playing table games, or cashing out, users know the rules and see consistent results. How Spartans Builds Trust Through Open Bonus Terms Spartans follows a simple approach: explain everything upfront. The 300% bonus is open to all users with no location limits or unclear terms. The structure is easy to follow: 300% bonus on first deposit 35x wagering requirement 7-day time limit Full withdrawal terms listed There are no unclear conditions or hidden limits. Users know what the bonus includes and how to make it work. This same openness is part of the entire platform. Return-to-player (RTP) details are visible. Game providers are listed. All game mechanics are set for fair play and easy tracking. Players are not left searching for answers or contacting support to find out where their funds went. In a market where shifting bonus rules and unclear systems are common, Spartans follows a clear and stable structure. Speed-First Payments Built for Crypto Users Most casinos still make players wait for their money. Spartans is built differently. Every deposit and withdrawal uses crypto, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether supported. Payouts are completed instantly. That’s not a future feature. It’s how the system already works. There are no slow payment services, long review checks, or delays linked to fiat currency. Once you request a withdrawal, the funds go straight to your wallet and can be tracked on-chain. This setup matters most for users playing fast-moving games like blackjack, roulette, or crash, or those active in live sports betting. When timing matters, slow systems are not acceptable. Spartans provides a payment system designed around crypto habits: fast, direct, and always in the user’s hands. Full Access Across Devices Without App Limits Spartans does not separate users by device, location, or app support. It runs completely in the browser, built for desktop and mobile, so everyone gets the same version of the platform. No player is limited by where they are or what device they use. There is no need to download anything or worry about system updates. Signup, deposit, and gameplay all start within seconds. Whether using a phone for live sports bets or a laptop for table games, the experience stays consistent and fast. This design choice is part of Spartans’ broader approach. Instead of putting features behind app stores or updates, everything is in one place. This also cuts down on risks, keeps the process smooth, and supports better performance overall. A Unified System for All Betting Formats Spartans is focused on doing key things well. With 5,963 games, support from over 43 providers, and a sportsbook that covers global events, it brings everything together in one easy-to-use platform. Players can move between crash games, casino tables, or sports bets with no delays. It works in real time and avoids the lag or clutter found on some larger platforms. The interface is designed for speed, helping users stay focused. Instead of packing in extra layers or pop-ups, the site keeps betting direct and responsive. Each part of the experience is shaped by three values: simple rules, fast crypto use, and stable design. A Setup That Prioritizes the Player Spartans is not trying to change how betting works. It is focusing on what matters: clarity, speed, and trust. With open bonus rules, fast crypto withdrawals, and full access without barriers, it removes the usual points of failure. There are no promised features waiting to launch or locked areas that require future updates. Spartans already runs at full capacity, offering tools that support real-time betting without slowing users down. For players who prefer direct systems and clear terms, this platform presents a working model. It avoids extra steps and focuses on delivering the basics well. In a field where many platforms still rely on unclear systems, Spartans stands out by simply doing what it says.

The company confirmed through an August 4 announcement on X that tens of thousands of Seeker units are currently en route to customers. Early recipients have verified the delivery and reported that the device is priced between $450-$500, featuring premium specifications including a MediaTek 8-core processor, 8GB of RAM paired with 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery with wireless charging capability.

Solana Seeker’s Decentralized Mobile Infrastructure Challenges Apple & Google Tech The Solana Seeker smartphone, first revealed in September 2024 , represents the successor to the Saga, Solana’s inaugural crypto-native device in its series of Web3-integrated mobile offerings. Market projections suggest the Seeker is positioned to generate approximately $67.5 million in gross revenue for Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of blockchain technology firm Solana Labs. Through the Seeker, Solana Mobile seeks to decentralize device economics and incentive structures. This vision is powered by TEEPIN (Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network), a technological framework. The system connects hardware components, verified software, users, and network Guardians to establish a truly decentralized mobile platform. Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile, emphasizes that the Seeker focuses on creating “rewarding” ecosystem connections rather than traditional mobile experiences. The future of mobile crypto is almost here – Seeker ships August 4th! @solanamobile GM @m_it unpacks the native SKR token, TEEPIN security stack, a growing dApp store 2.0, and opening the ecosystem to new devices. Can it become the gold standard for mobile crypto? pic.twitter.com/m8HThsr2qU — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 30, 2025 Hollyer explains, “ It revolutionizes the conventional mobile business model by providing stakeholders with actual platform ownership. “ Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, articulates the ambitious goal of establishing a premium mobile ecosystem capable of competing with industry giants Google and Apple. He further elaborates on the technical possibilities: “ For instance, when the Seeker mobile generates proprietary keys guaranteed against leakage, it can implement independent double-spend protection completely offline. Users could transmit or receive tokens, even execute smart contracts, without blockchain interaction or finalization delays. “ Solana SKR Token Airdrop Could Mirror BONK’s 30M Token Bonanza The Solana Seeker includes a Genesis NFT providing owners access to future airdrops, exclusive content, and reward programs, with particular focus on the planned native ecosystem token, SKR . SKR represents the native ecosystem token for Solana mobile devices, operating on Solana’s layer-1 blockchain and expected to be “airdropped directly to builders and users for ecosystem participation.” Many industry observers believe the SKR token airdrop could replicate the success of the BONK airdrop that revitalized Saga sales after months of sluggish performance. Market sentiment suggests strong potential for rapid sellout and contribution to the anticipated “Solana summer” positive momentum. The Solana Network and its ecosystem have demonstrated strong performance throughout 2025, positively influencing SOL cryptocurrency valuations. While SOL remains down year-to-date, the asset shows renewed upward momentum and appears positioned to challenge the $200 resistance level. Source: TradingView The Seeker mobile rollout announcement has already driven SOL prices up by 2.12%, with many analysts believing further gains could mirror the 14% surge witnessed when the Android device was initially unveiled at Token 2049 in Singapore. The potential approval of the first spot SOL ETFs by the SEC could serve as an additional rally catalyst. Recently, major firms, including Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Canary Capital, and CoinShares, submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, increasing approval odds to over 95% .

2025-08-05 06:25:42,49566609,1754375142,"Japan’s top negotiator, Akazawa visiting Washington today","Ryosei Akazawa, the head of Japan’s trade negotiating team, said he was leading his cavalry back to Washington starting today, August 5, to press for swift action on the auto tariff cut. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi also called for quicker issuance of Trump’s executive order to reduce auto tariffs from 27.5% to 15%. The Economic Revitalization Minister said his team “will push” the U.S. to ensure the executive order is prioritized and “the agreed tariff on automobiles and automotive components” is effected “as soon as possible.” Akazawa also mentioned that Japan was trying to avoid the “stacking” problem, where multiple tariffs could impact its goods. Last week, Prime Minister Ishiba said Japan exported nearly 4.318K products to the U.S. He added that his country was preparing necessary measures to cushion the effects of the high auto tariffs. Japan initially wanted those tariffs removed, but the U.S. stood its ground, leading Japan to agree to lower taxes. However, Akazawa was quoted last week saying it could take time for the 15% auto tariff rate to be effected. He hopes his team will succeed and seal the deal, similar to the auto tariff agreement recently entered into by the U.S. and Britain. Hayashi says the executive order will reduce uncertainty The Chief Cabinet Secretary recently said President Trump’s executive order to cut tariffs on Japanese automobile exports to the U.S. would reduce the uncertainty over “U.S. trade policy.” It would also mitigate the “downside risks” likely to affect Japan’s economy. If successful, the revised tariffs will be implemented from August 7. They were initially expected to take effect on August 1. Hayashi disclosed that Japan would continue to call on the U.S. to implement the revised bilateral agreement as soon as possible. He added that his country “will closely monitor” the progress on these talks on cars and auto parts. According to Hayashi and other Japanese officials, higher tariffs on Japanese cars dealt a massive blow to carmaking companies like Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp . The U.S. market is critical for both companies’ bottom lines. “We will continue to call for the United States to take measures to implement the bilateral agreement swiftly, including reductions in tariffs on cars and auto parts.” – Yoshimasa Hayashi , Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan Akazawa also emphasized that Japanese exports to the U.S. with a more than 15% levy should be exempted from the additional 15%. However, the head of the Democratic Party for the People, Yuichiro Tamaki, worried that the revised deal would not be enough to minimize the negative impact of tariffs on Japan’s economy. Noda believes the new deal should be formalized The head of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, Yoshihiko Noda, preferred the U.S.-Japan trade deal to be formalized in writing. He added that the signing should be a public event, like a bilateral summit. The former Prime Minister also stressed the need for the Japanese government to “draw up” an economic stimulus package to address any “tariff fallout.” However, he pointed out that Prime Minister Ishiba had not mentioned a supplementary budget for the 2025/26 fiscal year. Ishiba recently urged officials who attended a government task force meeting to “take all possible steps” to ease the impact of Trump’s tariffs. He claimed that the country’s economists had predicted things would be slow in the “export-driven economy.” However, just a day after the U.S.-Japan deal, the U.S. announced that Japan would buy $8 billion worth of U.S. farm and food products, such as bioethanol, fertilizers, corn, and soybeans. It also said Japan would buy more U.S.-made defense equipment worth billions of dollars annually. The Asian U.S. ally is also expected to buy about 100 Boeing planes.

Animoca Brands, a leading force in blockchain entertainment, recently announced significant backing for its pioneering Tower Ecosystem . This strategic move, confirmed by Chairman Yat Siu, signals a robust commitment to the future of decentralized gaming and a clear vote of confidence in its long-term potential. Why is Animoca Brands Offering Strong Animoca Brands Support ? Animoca Brands’ commitment to the Tower Ecosystem isn’t just a casual endorsement; it’s a profound statement about the future of Web3 gaming.

Yat Siu emphasized that Web3 gaming is crucial for building robust on-chain economies. These economies empower players, fostering vibrant communities and creating new opportunities for value creation that go beyond traditional gaming models. Animoca’s continued investment in projects like the Tower Ecosystem reinforces their leadership in this evolving space, tackling challenges such as player retention and sustainable economic models head-on.

Kaspa and VeChain remain top choices since they are affordable and possess compelling use cases. But Remittix, a fast-emerging cross-chain DeFi hub, is also picking up steam as a utility token with tremendous upside under $0.10 in price. While the majority of altcoins are not real-world focused, Remittix is vying for real crypto-to-fiat transactions, and a beta wallet will soon be arriving. These tokens, along with Kaspa and VeChain, represent low-cost entry points for investors looking for the next big altcoin to invest in 2025. Kaspa & VeChain: Budget-Friendly Options Under $0.15 Kaspa (KAS) trades around $0.08903, up some 4.88%, with a market cap of near $2.36 billion, and 24‑hour volume of $64.2 million, down about 16.65%. Kaspa’s strategy is focused on DAG‑based scalable transactions and fast block times. Price forecasts tend to cap its 2025 potential at below $0.23, and there are few who believe KAS will reach $1 before 2030 unless the acceptance accelerates sharply. VeChain (VET) stands at $0.02329, having decreased by 0.64%, and its market capitalization is around $2 billion while daily trading volume is about $37.1 million, down 8.2%. VeChain centers on supply-chain use cases with enterprise partnerships like Walmart China. Forecasts vary, but by the last quarter of 2025 price may reach more than $0.05 in optimistic forecasts. Neither VeChain nor Kaspa appears to touch $1 in this bull cycle based on current scale and growth trends—but they remain inexpensive tokens under $0.15. Remittix (RTX): Under-$0.10 Token That Actually Has Utility A great substitute for speculation tokens is Remittix (RTX) —a cross-chain DeFi token that represents a practical layer between crypto and fiat payments. At $0.0895 per token, Remittix has already sold more than 580 million+ tokens and raised more than $18 million, close to its soft cap. As opposed to Kaspa or VeChain, Remittix is targeting global remittances—enabling users to remit cryptocurrency to bank accounts in over 30 countries with real-time FX conversion and low gas fees. It just released its beta wallet, coming out in Q3 2025, with mobile-first UX and cross-chain support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Why Remittix Can Grow Further in This Cycle Global Reach: Payments to real bank accounts around the world Product-Ready: Beta wallet coming soon Presale Hype: $18 million + funded and tokens in demand soon Incentives: 40% token incentive now available Community Expansion: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway connecting stakeholders Remittix is crypto with real utility, offering an onramp for early-stage investors and growth-oriented crypto hunters seeking real application. If you’re holding your watch on Kaspa, VeChain, or Cardano as sub-$0.15 plays, it’s worth watching Remittix, which has affordability, utility, and high project traction—all while preparing to roll out the wallet and make listing announcements.

2025-08-05 06:17:27,49567517,1754374647,From coffee money to $5: This token mirrors early BTC growth in terms of ROI,"Early phase investor gains mirror Bitcoin (BTC)’s rise Consider an investor who diversified $1,000 from popular cryptocurrencies such as AVAX or SOL during Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 1 presale, when the token price was just $0.01. Fast forward to Phase 6 pricing at $0.035, and that same investment would now be valued at approximately $3,500, reflecting a remarkable 250% gain. But the growth story doesn’t stop there. With the presale advancing and listing anticipated at $0.06, projections suggest the token could reach $0.60 or beyond in the future, representing a staggering 60x return on early capital. This kind of return aligns with Bitcoin (BTC)’s early growth pattern, where investors who believed in the concept at ground level witnessed unparalleled profits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers this rare chance to capture similar exponential gains before the wider market fully embraces the token’s potential. The steadily increasing interest, rising number of holders, and growing capital raised all signal a powerful momentum building behind MUTM. The mechanics behind the growth What fuels this growth potential is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative approach to decentralized finance. At its core lies the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system, where users deposit stablecoins or blue-chip assets like ETH and USDT, receiving mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens accumulate yield automatically, increasing in value without requiring constant user intervention. This compounding effect provides a steady, passive income stream that benefits holders over time. Beyond simple yield generation, mtTokens can be staked within Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts to earn additional MUTM tokens. This staking mechanism not only increases holdings without added risk but also reinforces long-term loyalty to the ecosystem. To enhance scarcity and support token value, a portion of the platform revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, actively controlling the circulating supply and creating upward price pressure. This blend of automatic interest accrual, dual-token rewards, and buyback strategies sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from traditional DeFi projects, offering users a comprehensive system designed for sustainable growth. Presale details fueling excitement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. Over 10% of the allocated 170 million tokens for this phase have already been snapped up by a rapidly expanding community exceeding 14,900 holders. This phase alone has attracted more than $14 million in capital, reflecting strong confidence in the project’s future. The next phase will see the token price increase by 15% to $0.040, emphasizing urgency for those eyeing entry before costs rise. With a total supply capped at four billion MUTM tokens, demand pulls scenario will become an increasingly important factor in price discovery. Security and trust are central pillars of the project, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) passing a thorough CertiK audit, scoring an impressive 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet. Additional incentives such as a $100,000 giveaway —where ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM—and an active $50,000 bug bounty program contribute to growing community engagement and confidence. Bitcoin (BTC)’s early believers find a new frontier Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a compelling chance to replicate the early successes of Bitcoin (BTC), still trading below $0.04 and backed by a clear, ambitious roadmap. The upcoming Beta launch at listing will enable users to interact with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s full DeFi suite from day one, signaling a significant milestone toward mainstream adoption. Layer-2 integration is set to provide low gas fees and scalable infrastructure, solving many of the pain points that early DeFi users have encountered elsewhere. Coupled with anticipated major exchange listings on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and others, these developments will open the floodgates for liquidity and mass user participation. This combination of proven fundamentals, growing adoption, and carefully planned expansion makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an unmatched opportunity in today’s market. The time to act is now For many, the decision to skip their daily coffee and invest that small amount instead in Bitcoin (BTC)’s early days was the start of extraordinary financial journeys. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a similar “coffee money bet” with the potential to deliver comparable returns. Phase 6 is progressing quickly, and once the price jumps to $0.040, the window to buy at $0.035 will have closed. Investors who move now position themselves ahead of the curve, gaining early exposure to a platform poised for massive growth. This is more than just another token presale—it’s an invitation to be part of what could become one of the most significant DeFi success stories of 2025. Don’t let this chance slip by. The future of your portfolio might just start with a $5 coffee-sized investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

2025-08-05 06:10:10,49565687,1754374210,Unveiling Critical BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling Critical BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Understanding the pulse of the cryptocurrency market is crucial for any trader or investor. One of the most telling indicators of market sentiment, especially for Bitcoin, comes from analyzing BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios. These ratios offer a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate price increases (longs) or decreases (shorts). What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Reveal? For those engaged in crypto trading , knowing the collective leanings of the market can provide a significant edge. The long-short ratio essentially compares the number of long positions to short positions on perpetual futures contracts. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 points to more short positions, indicating bearish sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures across various exchanges shows a slight lean towards short positions. The total ratio stands at: Total: Long 49.47%, Short 50.53% This suggests that, overall, a marginally larger percentage of traders are betting on a downward price movement for Bitcoin in the immediate future. Analyzing Current Market Sentiment: Why It Matters for Crypto Trading Gauging market sentiment is not just an academic exercise; it has practical implications for your trading strategy. When the market is predominantly short, it might signal potential capitulation or, conversely, an opportunity for a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly reverse. Conversely, a heavily long market could be ripe for a correction. It is important to remember that these ratios represent aggregated positions and do not necessarily predict future price movements with certainty. However, they do reflect the current psychological state of the market participants, which can often influence short-term trends. Monitoring these shifts helps traders adapt their strategies. Diving Deeper into Bitcoin Derivatives: Exchange-Specific Insights While the overall picture gives us a broad understanding, examining individual exchanges provides a more granular view of Bitcoin derivatives activity. Different exchanges attract different types of traders, and their specific ratios can sometimes reveal localized trends or the influence of larger players on a particular platform. Here are the 24-hour long-short ratios for three prominent exchanges: Binance: Long 48.78%, Short 51.22% Bybit: Long 47.03%, Short 52.97% Gate.io: Long 49.20%, Short 50.80% Notice that Bybit shows the strongest short bias among the top three, indicating a more bearish outlook from its user base compared to Binance or Gate.io. This variance highlights the diverse trading behaviors across platforms, which is crucial for comprehensive market analysis. Actionable Insights from Futures Contracts Data What can you do with this information about futures contracts ? Firstly, use it as a complementary tool, not a standalone indicator. Combine long-short ratios with technical analysis, on-chain data, and macroeconomic factors for a more robust trading plan. Secondly, be aware of extremes. Historically, extreme long or short biases have sometimes preceded market reversals. If everyone is on one side of the trade, the potential for a swift move in the opposite direction increases. For instance, a sudden shift from a heavily short-biased market to a more balanced or even long-biased one could signal a change in momentum. Conversely, if short positions continue to dominate, it might confirm a prevailing bearish trend, prompting caution for those considering long entries. Navigating the Dynamics of BTC Perpetual Futures The world of BTC perpetual futures is dynamic and constantly evolving. Staying informed about these crucial metrics helps you navigate its complexities. Understanding who is long and who is short provides a valuable lens through which to view potential price action and market sentiment shifts. Always conduct your own research and consider multiple data points before making any trading decisions. By regularly reviewing long-short ratios, you empower yourself with a deeper understanding of the collective market psychology, enabling more informed and potentially more profitable crypto trading strategies. This data is a powerful tool for anticipating market shifts and managing risk effectively. In conclusion, the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a vital snapshot of current market sentiment. While the slight short bias across major exchanges indicates a cautious outlook, understanding these dynamics on an exchange-specific level provides deeper insights. Utilize this data as part of a comprehensive analysis to enhance your decision-making in the volatile crypto markets. Staying informed about these metrics is key to successful trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a long-short ratio in crypto trading? The long-short ratio compares the total number of open long positions (bets on price increase) to open short positions (bets on price decrease) for a specific cryptocurrency on derivatives exchanges. It indicates prevailing market sentiment. Why are BTC perpetual futures important for market analysis? BTC perpetual futures are widely traded derivatives that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price without owning the underlying asset. Their long-short ratios provide a real-time gauge of bullish or bearish sentiment among a large segment of crypto traders. How do different exchanges’ long-short ratios vary? Long-short ratios can vary significantly between exchanges due to differences in user bases, liquidity, and regional trading preferences. Analyzing these individual exchange ratios can reveal specific trading behaviors and localized sentiment trends. Can long-short ratios predict future Bitcoin price movements? While long-short ratios are strong indicators of current market sentiment, they are not direct predictors of future price movements. They are best used as a complementary tool alongside technical analysis, on-chain data, and other fundamental factors to form a comprehensive trading strategy. What does a higher short percentage mean for BTC perpetual futures? A higher short percentage, as seen in the recent data, indicates that a larger proportion of traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to fall. This suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term, though extreme biases can sometimes precede reversals. Found this analysis of BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios insightful?

2025-08-05 06:00:29,49565251,1754373629,Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer,"After falling below a crucial support level, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to recover some of its lost ground. An analyst suggested that this week’s performance will be decisive for the cryptocurrency’s next trend. Related Reading: Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is Headed For $9,000 After This Broadening Wedge Retest Bitcoin Loses Bull Flag Formation Over the weekend, Bitcoin lost its post-breakout range for the first time in three weeks, falling to a local low of $112,296 on August 3. The flagship crypto had been trading between the $114,000-$120,000 range since the early July breakout, hitting its all-time high (ATH) of $122,838 amid the rally. As July neared its end, BTC experienced some volatility, retesting the range lows twice over its last week. However, the cryptocurrency was unable to repeat its price recovery from the previous weekend, losing the crucial area on August 1. Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin’s rally could be at risk, explaining that BTC has formed a bull flag in the weekly chart and held the pattern’s lows as support until the latest Weekly Close. Following its recent price action, the analyst considers that this week’s performance will be pivotal to see whether the pattern’s bottom, around the $117,200 area, will become a new resistance and confirm the breakdown, or if the flagship crypto’s price will recover the structure. According to the analysis, if the price can reclaim the structure, the correction would be considered a fake downside deviation before resynchronizing with the pattern. Meanwhile, turning the pattern’s bottom into resistance would be a bearish retest, confirming the breakdown, and potentially leading to a new retest of the $112,000 area as support. BTC’s Weekly Close To Determine Next Trend Rekt Capital also detailed that this week’s performance will determine the future of BTC’s second Price Discovery uptrend, which has technically started its fifth week. Depending on what happens to the Bull Flag (reclaim or a confirmation of the breakdown), we will know whether the Price Discovery Uptrend 2 will continue or whether BTC has experienced a very short PDU2 instead. Last week, the analyst retesting that the continuation of the Price Discovery trend could fail as BTC transitioned into weeks 5-7 of this phase. Historically, the second uptrend has started to slow down around Weeks 5-6, hitting its peak during this “Danger Zone.” If Bitcoin reclaims the Bull Flag and challenges new highs, then its second Price Discovery uptrend will progress according to its historical tendencies. However, if it fails to Weekly Close above the pattern’s bottom and confirms additional downside, the second Price Discovery uptrend would have ended in Week 2, much quicker than has historically been the case. Moreover, it would reveal that BTC has been in its second Price Discovery Correction, which “would be going completely against the grain of history.” Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level The analyst suggested that macro-wise, Bitcoin still has plenty of time for a third Price Discovery uptrend. If the second phase has already ended, a final uptrend could overcompensate for the current uptrend’s underperformance. Previously, Rekt Capital asserted that what comes after the second uptrend would depend on how long the corrective phase takes, as a shot correction could allow for a third uptrend before the bear market.

2025-08-05 06:00:07,49565172,1754373607,Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With Massive Third-Largest Acquisition,"Michael Saylor’s enterprise software company, Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), has made headlines once again with a substantial Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition, pushing its total holdings beyond 600,000 coins. The company purchased an impressive $2.46 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past week, marking its third-largest purchase by dollar amount since it began acquiring the digital asset five years ago. Bitcoin Acquisition At Record Prices Between July 28 and August 3, Strategy added 21,021 Bitcoin to its holdings, bringing its total to 628,791 tokens. At current market prices, the firm’s portfolio is valued at over $71 billion. Saylor has adeptly transformed his company from a traditional software provider into the leading corporate buyer of Bitcoin, utilizing innovative financial strategies to fuel these purchases. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ The latest acquisition was made at an average price of $117,526 per token, which is the second-highest price the company has ever paid, just shy of the $118,940 average from the previous month. Strategy is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. BTC mining company MARA Holdings is second with 50,000 coins, which highlights Saylor’s firm’s purchasing power. Notably, this position has not only solidified Saylor’s influence in the crypto space but has also inspired other public companies to adopt similar treasury strategies aimed at accumulating and holding digital currencies. These include Trump’s social media company, boosted by a new regulatory regime and legislation in the US aimed at positioning the country as the crypto capital of the world, a mission that President Donald Trump has advocated since his election campaign last year. Saylor’s Strategy Pledges To Protect Shareholder Value To fund these massive purchases, Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor has employed a mix of common and preferred share sales alongside debt instruments. Recently, the company launched its latest preferred stock offering, dubbed “Stretch,” in late July. In its second-quarter report, Strategy announced an unrealized gain of $14 billion, primarily driven by the recent rebound in Bitcoin prices and a new accounting requirement that necessitated the revaluation of its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor has also made a commitment to investors, stating that he will refrain from issuing new common shares at less than 2.5 times the company’s net asset value, except for covering debt interest or preferred dividends. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level This pledge comes in light of concerns raised by critics like Jim Chanos, who have expressed apprehension about the premium that Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings place on its share price and the numerous securities offerings the company has executed. Since its initial foray into Bitcoin, Strategy’s stock, MSTR, has skyrocketed over 3,000%, significantly outperforming Bitcoin itself and major stock indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. The company’s largest purchases occurred in November, totaling $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, demonstrating Saylor’s aggressive strategy in the cryptocurrency market. However, on Monday, the firm did not disclose any further purchases, as it has commonly done over the past few months. Perhaps it is starting to reassess its direction with biweekly acquisitions. It remains to be seen what the firm’s next moves will be, as there have been no further official comments on the matter.

CEO Shin Jin-wook already faces a 7-year sentence in prison for stealing 10 billion won ($7.5 million) worth of customer deposits. South Korean media outlet Digital Asset reported that a Daegu District Court judge sentenced Shin for his alleged involvement in Bitsonic Coin (BSC) fraud. CEO Admits to Bitsonic Coin Fraud The CEO defrauded customers for a total of 160 million won ($115K) “by inflating BSC trading volume and market price after inducing transactions through false announcements,” the verdict noted. Shin used false KRW points obtained via buybacks to purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum from members. He later converted the digital assets into cash and invested in firms unrelated to the exchange, it added. Additionally, he falsified the lockup period, only to discover that neither the investment nor interest could be returned to investors. “Although Mr. Shin was unable to reach an agreement with the victims, he admitted his wrongdoing and is reflecting on it,” said Judge Seong Gi-jun. “The sentencing conditions, including the motive and circumstances of the crime, were taken into consideration when determining the sentence.” Here’s How Bitsonic Chiefs Landed in “Lenient” Sentences In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic’s chief technology officer, surnamed Bae, were sentenced to a combined 8 years in prison for manipulating crypto prices and hugely profiting from them. Per a Seoul District Court, Shin had “reached an agreement with two of the victims who suffered the largest amount of damages,” at the time. Further, neither CEO Shin nor Bae had a history of committing similar types of crime, the Judge noted. This led the Judge to sentence both Bitsonic chiefs to a “lenient” sentence. Besides, under South Korean law, defendants can appeal guilty verdicts and sentences at the High Court and the Supreme Court.

2025-08-05 05:50:47,49566872,1754373047,XRP Breaks $3 With $33M Traded in a Minute. Here's What Analysis Predicts Next,"XRP surged to $3.05 during a volatile 24-hour period, posting a 4.45% gain from $2.92 as traders reacted to unprecedented minute-level volumes and whale liquidations. A $33 million spike in volume was recorded within a single minute, marking one of the largest such spikes for the token. Despite technical resistance at $3.09 and short-term sell signals flashing, machine-learning forecasts continue to target upside toward $3.12 by month-end. What to Know XRP rallied from $2.92 to $3.05 between 3 August 21:00 and 4 August 20:00, gaining 4.45% with a trading range of $0.18 (6% spread). The $3.00 psychological level was breached during the 13:00–14:00 session on extreme volume, peaking at 151.97 million trades. Institutional trading triggered $2.10 billion in sell flows, even as leveraged long positions totaling $14 million were opened on major exchanges. A single-minute volume record of $33 million was observed during the height of the breakout. AI trading models from multiple platforms forecast $3.12 by 31 August, despite the upcoming SEC regulatory status update on 15 August. The TD Sequential indicator flashed a sell signal on the three-day chart, suggesting a short-term top may be forming. News Background The price spike followed a broader risk-on move in crypto markets as traders rotated out of lower-cap altcoins and into high-liquidity majors. However, on-chain data revealed aggressive sell-side flows from whale addresses and smart money funds—raising concerns that the rally may have been driven by short-term positioning ahead of regulatory catalysts. The SEC is expected to clarify XRP’s securities treatment by mid-August, a potential binary event for the token. Price Action Summary XRP hit intraday highs of $3.08 before fading slightly to close the session at $3.05. Price action reversed sharply at $3.09, establishing the level as near-term resistance. Support was observed at $2.97 during the 05:00–06:00 window, with back-to-back volumes of 57.65 million and 44.77 million. The final hour saw a $0.01 range between $3.04 and $3.05 with high intrabar volatility and no clear directional bias. Technical Analysis Price held above the $3.00 psychological zone but failed to break higher despite massive volume surges. TD Sequential shows a 9-count sell signal on 3D, typically followed by consolidation or downside pressure. RSI on the 1H and 4H remains elevated but has not crossed into extreme overbought territory. The $3.09 rejection came on 69.89 million volume, well above the 24H average of 62.11 million. What Traders Are Watching Whether XRP can maintain support above $3.00 heading into the weekend. The impact of the SEC’s mid-August decision on XRP’s market classification. If institutional sellers re-enter at $3.10+ or if long exposure builds at current levels.

2025-08-05 05:45:30,49564651,1754372730,Top Analyst Forecasts Just Dropped – 7 Best Cryptos to Watch in 2025,"What if the next wealth-shifting crypto wasn’t already on everyone’s radar? Meme coins have graduated from joke status to serious financial contenders. Investors across the globe are now seeing these viral tokens turn modest entries into portfolio-transforming moves. This wave isn’t slowing – it’s gaining speed, traction, and attention. Among this evolving pack, one name stands tall with a strategic edge. The MoonBull Whitelist is now live, offering early access to those watching closely. This rare chance opens the gates to what could be one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025, alongside an exciting new generation of meme-driven assets including Fartcoin, Degen, ANDY, Osaka Protocol, Test, and Coq Inu. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Strategic Entry Point Investors Crave The MoonBull Whitelist is now open, sparking a wave of urgency among smart crypto enthusiasts. This Ethereum-based meme coin has engineered a limited early-access model that positions its supporters for maximum leverage. With only a finite number of whitelist slots, timing becomes the ultimate edge. Whitelist members unlock privileged access before the presale opens to the public. They receive the lowest possible token entry price, secret staking reward opportunities, exclusive token drops, and roadmap hints unavailable to outsiders. Each benefit is tailored to empower early supporters before the crypto world catches on. When Early Access Pays Off: A Look at Prior Whitelist Victories Human behavior is wired to seek exclusivity. Scarcity fuels action, especially when rewards are hidden behind a countdown. The MoonBull Whitelist taps into this psychology masterfully. The desire to be first, the stress of missing out, and the rush of privilege create an emotional loop that compels immediate action. In 2021, early participants in Shiba Inu’s public trading phase saw unprecedented gains, with some wallets witnessing over 100,000% increases according to blockchain analytics from Etherscan and CoinGecko historical data. Likewise, Floki Inu’s early backers gained significant value during its viral expansion phase, with multiple wallet addresses multiplying their holdings in weeks, as tracked by BscScan and major price aggregators. The history of early access yielding oversized returns is well-documented – and MoonBull’s current whitelist strategy positions it to potentially follow a similar trajectory. This strategic architecture, paired with Ethereum’s rock-solid DeFi base, places MoonBull among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 2. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): A Token That Breaks the Rules Fartcoin began as a laugh, but today it’s commanding serious attention. Built around shock value and unapologetic meme energy, this coin is dominating online traffic across Reddit, Telegram, and TikTok. Its strong community and viral spread give it the kind of grassroots fuel that meme coins thrive on. The tokenomics offer an aggressive burn model and redistribution incentives that reward long-term holders. With each transaction, a portion is burned, creating scarcity, while holders receive small rewards, encouraging retention. That duality – deflation and passive income – is what draws savvy investors. More than just a meme, Fartcoin is expanding its use cases in gaming and tipping platforms, adding long-term potential to its marketability. Its unconventional branding makes it stand out, but its strong fundamentals place it confidently among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 3. Degen ($DEGEN): The Community-First Coin With Powerhouse Energy Degen is not just a coin – it’s an identity. Crafted for high-risk traders and internet-native investors, $DEGEN celebrates the chaotic charm of crypto culture. Its launch was one of the most talked-about entries of Q2, with over 100,000 holders in its first 48 hours. The project’s roadmap includes community voting tools, staking pools, and exclusive NFT collaborations. A DAO-based structure ensures that major decisions lie in the hands of its most loyal users. The inclusivity model adds legitimacy, pulling more people into the fold. Degen’s marketing strategy focuses heavily on virality, gamification, and influencer partnerships, fueling further momentum. The coin’s ability to convert raw culture into real value has made it a front-runner among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 4. ANDY ($ANDY): The Cultural Meme That’s Winning Big Support $ANDY has gained significant traction as the meme coin that blends culture, nostalgia, and social media flair. Inspired by quirky internet characters and powered by a community of content creators, its engagement rates outpace many mid-cap tokens. The token is deflationary with a capped supply, and its roadmap includes creator-centric initiatives like exclusive merchandise and fan-driven project expansions. With mainstream appeal and the ability to draw in both crypto natives and pop culture fans, ANDY has carved out a lane of its own. The coin’s fast-rising market cap, driven largely by online influencers and YouTube communities, hints at untapped potential. This digital blend of personality and performance ensures ANDY’s place among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 5. Osaka Protocol ($OSAK): The Underdog Protocol With Big-Budget Vision Osaka Protocol enters the meme space with technical depth and a long-term playbook. Built on a hybrid Ethereum layer-2 model, $OSAK focuses on combining meme momentum with security and scalability. The protocol introduces smart contract features tailored for meme coin ecosystems, including a secure staking model and on-chain voting. It plans integrations with major DeFi platforms and DEXs to extend token utility. Its whitepaper reveals serious intent – a rarity in the meme space. Backed by an anonymous but verified dev team and multiple audits, Osaka has found favor with those who value both credibility and virality. These strategic advantages solidify its inclusion as one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 6. Test ($TST): This Coin Challenges Definitions Test started as a joke – a coin literally called Test – but its simplicity and irony sparked curiosity. That curiosity snowballed into one of the fastest-growing Telegram groups in the meme coin space. The $TST token is used in experimental NFT drops and community challenges that reward both participation and loyalty. Its gamified structure and unpredictable campaigns keep users engaged daily. With a flexible framework and a knack for surprise, Test proves that the unexpected often outperforms the over-engineered. Its rapid growth and social experimentation make Test a wild card among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 7. Coq Inu ($COQ): High Engagement Meets High Volume Coq Inu blends meme aesthetics with tokenomics designed for volume. With over 150,000 holders and rising liquidity, $COQ is proving that meme coins can hold weight over time. It runs on a reflection-based system, where holders receive passive income in $COQ tokens from every transaction. Paired with marketing campaigns that include Twitter raids and celebrity shoutouts, the momentum is undeniable. The roadmap teases future metaverse integrations and limited-time burns, increasing scarcity while maintaining virality. Coq Inu’s ability to keep up with evolving market trends locks its status as one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. Conclusion: What This All Means for 2025 Based on the latest research, the best cryptos to watch in 2025 include MoonBull, Fartcoin, Degen, ANDY, Osaka Protocol, Test, and Coq Inu. Each of these projects represents a different angle of meme coin dominance, from community-first to deflationary supply models and creator-centric ecosystems. MoonBull stands apart with its exclusive whitelist mechanics, early supporter rewards, and Ethereum foundation. While others bring volume, culture, and innovation, Moon Bull fuses all three with high-stakes entry mechanics designed to favor the early movers. As countries begin stacking Bitcoin reserves and retail adoption accelerates, meme coins with utility and branding strength may become the next wave of mass-adopted digital assets.

2025-08-05 05:40:10,49564368,1754372410,Revolutionary Stablecoin Pre-Paid Cards: Danal Powers Korea’s Seamless Crypto Payments,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Stablecoin Pre-Paid Cards: Danal Powers Korea’s Seamless Crypto Payments Imagine a world where using cryptocurrency for everyday purchases is as simple as swiping a card. That future is rapidly approaching in South Korea, thanks to a groundbreaking initiative by Danal. This prominent South Korean payments firm, known for its cryptocurrency Paycoin (PCI), is set to revolutionize how foreigners spend money in the country by introducing stablecoin pre-paid cards . This innovative step marks a significant leap forward in making digital assets truly usable in daily life, addressing a critical need for seamless international transactions. What Makes These Stablecoin Pre-Paid Cards a Game Changer? Danal’s ambitious plan involves integrating stablecoins directly into pre-paid cards specifically designed for foreign visitors and residents in South Korea. Set to launch in the third quarter of this year, this initiative is monumental. It will be the very first time a Korean company enables direct stablecoin payments through a card product. This pioneering move addresses a crucial need, considering that foreign visitors spent an astonishing 56 trillion won ($40.3 billion) using pre-paid cards in South Korea during 2023 alone, according to the Migration Research and Training Centre (MRTC). The introduction of these cards means foreigners can potentially bypass complex currency exchange processes, which often involve unfavorable rates and additional fees. Instead, they can convert their stablecoins into local currency on the card, making transactions seamless and more cost-effective. This innovation simplifies spending and significantly enhances convenience for a large and economically vital demographic. How Will Danal Stablecoin Cards Operate for Users? While specific technical details are still emerging, the core concept revolves around leveraging stablecoins for everyday transactions. Danal has already laid some strategic groundwork, including recent trademark filings related to stablecoins, which clearly indicate their long-term commitment to this transformative technology. The integration will likely involve a user-friendly application or platform where individuals can load their stablecoins onto the card. At the point of sale, the system would then convert the stablecoin holdings into the required fiat currency (Korean Won), allowing users to spend as they would with any traditional pre-paid card. For existing users of Paycoin, Danal’s own cryptocurrency, this development could also mean enhanced utility and a more direct pathway to spending their digital assets. The firm’s deep roots in the crypto space suggest a smooth and intuitive transition for those already familiar with digital assets. These crypto payment cards are designed to bridge the gap between the volatile digital asset world and the stability of traditional commerce, offering a practical, real-world solution for millions. Boosting Accessibility with Korean Stablecoin Payments The implications of Danal’s initiative extend far beyond mere transactional convenience. By offering accessible Korean stablecoin payments via widely accepted pre-paid cards, Danal is actively promoting the mainstream adoption of digital currencies. This strategic move can significantly lower the barrier to entry for individuals who might be hesitant to use cryptocurrencies directly due to perceived complexity or volatility, but who are perfectly comfortable with familiar card-based transactions. Furthermore, this development showcases South Korea’s progressive stance on financial innovation and its willingness to embrace cutting-edge technologies. This pioneering effort could inspire other companies globally to explore similar solutions, fostering a more interconnected and digitally-enabled global economy. The potential for broader Paycoin integration into various payment ecosystems also grows significantly, solidifying its position as a practical digital currency. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Considerations The introduction of these cards brings numerous advantages: Seamless Transactions: Foreigners can avoid high foreign exchange fees and the hassle of physical currency conversion, making their visits more enjoyable and economical. Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins become genuinely practical for everyday spending, moving beyond speculative investment. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Leveraging blockchain technology for underlying transactions can offer improved security and auditability. Broader Adoption: This initiative encourages wider acceptance and understanding of digital assets among the general public and merchants. Economic Boost: By simplifying spending for foreigners, it could further stimulate the tourism and retail sectors. However, like any innovative leap, there are considerations: Regulatory Clarity: Navigating evolving cryptocurrency regulations in South Korea and internationally will be crucial for long-term success. User Education: Ensuring users fully understand how to manage their stablecoin holdings and card usage, including any potential fees or limits, is vital. Merchant Acceptance: While the cards function like regular pre-paid cards, ensuring widespread merchant understanding and acceptance is key. Danal’s venture into stablecoin pre-paid cards is a bold and strategic step, positioning them at the forefront of crypto innovation in the global payment sector. It highlights a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into our financial routines. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Payments Begins Danal’s launch of Korea’s first stablecoin pre-paid cards represents a pivotal moment for digital payments worldwide. This groundbreaking initiative not only simplifies financial transactions for foreigners in South Korea but also sets a powerful precedent for how stablecoins can integrate into mainstream commerce globally. By effectively bridging the gap between digital currencies and traditional spending habits, Danal is paving the way for a more accessible, efficient, and technologically advanced financial future. This development profoundly underscores the growing utility and practical applications of stablecoins, further highlighting South Korea’s significant role as a leader in fintech innovation and the practical adoption of blockchain technology.

2025-08-05 05:30:11,49563932,1754371811,USDC Withdrawals: Binance Announces Crucial Temporary Suspension for Network Maintenance,"BitcoinWorld USDC Withdrawals: Binance Announces Crucial Temporary Suspension for Network Maintenance Exciting news often dominates the crypto space, but sometimes, important operational updates take center stage. Crypto users are currently buzzing about a significant announcement from Binance regarding USDC withdrawals . The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, recently informed its users about a temporary suspension of USDC withdrawals on several popular blockchain networks. This move is a direct result of scheduled wallet maintenance, a routine but crucial part of ensuring the platform’s stability and security. Why Are USDC Withdrawals Temporarily Paused on Binance? Binance announced on its official website that it will temporarily suspend USDC withdrawals across five prominent networks. These include Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Optimism (OP). The suspension is set to begin at 07:00 UTC on August 6. The primary reason for this temporary halt is scheduled wallet maintenance. Think of it like essential roadwork – inconvenient for a short period, but vital for long-term smooth operation. Ethereum (ETH): A foundational blockchain, widely used for DeFi and NFTs. Polygon (POL): A popular Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, known for lower fees. Arbitrum (ARB): Another leading Layer-2 solution, enhancing Ethereum’s scalability. Base (BASE): Coinbase’s new Ethereum Layer-2, gaining traction. Optimism (OP): A robust Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, focusing on speed and cost-efficiency. This proactive step by Binance highlights its commitment to maintaining a secure and efficient trading environment. Such planned maintenance activities are standard practice within the industry to upgrade systems, enhance security protocols, and improve overall service reliability. While a temporary inconvenience, it ultimately benefits users by ensuring the integrity of their assets. Understanding the Impact of Binance USDC Suspension A temporary Binance USDC suspension might raise questions for users, but it is important to understand its nature. This is not a halt to all USDC transactions on Binance, but specifically withdrawals on the listed networks. Users can still trade USDC on the exchange and potentially withdraw via other available networks if supported. However, for those relying on these specific chains for their USDC movements, planning is key. The impact is largely limited to the withdrawal function for a specific stablecoin on particular networks. It is a brief pause, not a permanent change. Binance aims to complete this wallet maintenance efficiently, restoring full withdrawal capabilities as soon as possible. Keeping an eye on Binance’s official announcements will provide the most accurate updates regarding the resumption of services. This event serves as a reminder for all crypto users about the importance of diversification in their asset management strategies. Relying on a single network or exchange for all operations can sometimes lead to temporary disruptions. Always consider having multiple avenues for managing your digital assets. Navigating Stablecoin Withdrawal Issues: What Users Should Know When facing stablecoin withdrawal issues , staying calm and informed is crucial. First, always check the official announcements from the crypto exchange. Binance, for instance, communicates such updates clearly on its website and social media channels. During periods of wallet maintenance Binance undertakes, it’s best to avoid initiating withdrawals on the affected networks to prevent potential delays or complications. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Updated: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements page or their social media for real-time updates on the maintenance status. Consider Alternatives: If urgent USDC transfers are needed, explore if Binance supports withdrawals on other networks not affected by this maintenance. Alternatively, consider converting USDC to another stablecoin or cryptocurrency that is available for withdrawal on your preferred network, if that aligns with your strategy. Plan Ahead: For future transactions, be aware that scheduled maintenance can occur. Planning your withdrawals in advance can help avoid last-minute inconveniences. These temporary measures are a testament to the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. A proactive approach from a leading crypto exchange updates its infrastructure to ensure long-term stability and security for its users. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Exchange Updates? This incident underscores the ongoing need for crypto exchanges to perform regular maintenance. As blockchain technology evolves, so too must the infrastructure supporting it. Such planned downtimes are a sign of a mature platform committed to security and efficiency. Users can expect more transparent communication around these events, which helps build trust and understanding within the community. It reinforces the idea that even in the fast-paced world of crypto, careful and deliberate operational management is paramount. In conclusion, Binance’s temporary suspension of USDC withdrawals on select networks for scheduled wallet maintenance is a routine yet vital operational decision. While it requires users to adjust their plans temporarily, it ultimately contributes to a more secure and reliable crypto ecosystem. Staying informed and understanding the reasons behind such actions empowers users to navigate the crypto landscape with confidence. This commitment to robust infrastructure ensures a safer environment for everyone involved in digital asset transactions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Binance suspending USDC withdrawals on certain networks? Binance is temporarily suspending USDC withdrawals due to scheduled wallet maintenance, which is a routine procedure to ensure the security and efficiency of the exchange’s systems. Q2: Which networks are affected by the USDC withdrawal suspension? The affected networks for USDC withdrawals are Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Optimism (OP). Q3: Can I still trade USDC on Binance during the suspension? Yes, the suspension specifically applies to withdrawals on the listed networks. You can still trade USDC on Binance’s spot market or use it within other unaffected services on the platform. Q4: How long will the USDC withdrawal suspension last? The announcement states the suspension begins at 07:00 UTC on August 6. Binance aims to complete the wallet maintenance efficiently, and users should monitor official Binance announcements for updates on the resumption of services. Q5: What should I do if I need to withdraw USDC urgently? If urgent withdrawals are necessary, check if Binance supports USDC withdrawals on other networks not affected by this maintenance. Alternatively, you might consider converting your USDC to another stablecoin or cryptocurrency available for withdrawal on your preferred network, if that aligns with your strategy.

2025-08-05 05:30:00,49564008,1754371800,George Osborne Warns UK Is Losing Crypto Edge,"In a Financial Times op-ed, Osborne explained that the UK risks losing its status as a financial leader while the US advances through initiatives like the GENIUS Act. Osborne criticized Chancellor Rachel Reeves and supported Coinbase’s controversial ad campaign, which mocked the UK’s economic stagnation and pointed to crypto as an alternative. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act itself is under scrutiny in the US for banning yield-bearing stablecoins. Critics say this favors traditional banks and undermines stablecoin innovation. Other experts argue that tokenized money market funds may benefit, but stablecoins still hold an edge in DeFi. UK Missing Crypto Opportunity George Osborne, the former UK chancellor and now adviser to Coinbase, issued a stark warning that the United Kingdom is falling behind in the digital asset race, particularly in the stablecoin sector. In a recent Financial Times op-ed , Osborne voiced his concerns over the UK’s sluggish progress in adopting crypto-friendly policies, and argued that the country is at risk of squandering its position as a global financial leader. George Osborne He criticized the government’s inaction, especially with regards to stablecoins, which he sees as essential tools for reducing friction in global finance. Osborne stated that while the US is forging ahead with initiatives like the GENIUS Act to cement the dollar’s dominance in the stablecoin space, the UK risks irrelevance. He warned that the British pound — one of the world’s most traded currencies — may not even play a supporting role in the digital economy if current trends continue. Osborne’s critique was aimed in part at current Chancellor Rachel Reeves, whom he accused of failing to deliver on promises to support innovation in the digital currency sector. His comments were made after a controversial ad campaign by Coinbase titled “Everything Is Fine,” a satirical musical piece that mocks the UK’s economic stagnation and cost-of-living crisis. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the ad was banned by UK television networks. It suggests that the traditional financial system is broken and points to crypto as a modern alternative. While the ad’s ban could not be independently verified by CNBC, it has nevertheless led to some debate and drew attention to Coinbase’s growing lobbying efforts in the UK. Coinbase entered the UK market in 2015, and has been an aggressive force in shaping crypto regulation. This is particularly true in the US where it spent more on lobbying than any other crypto firm, according to Politico and OpenSecrets. Osborne’s op-ed and the company's latest campaign indicate that there is now a renewed push to influence policy in Britain. Critics Question GENIUS Act Motives While the US is making more progress with its GENIUS Act, it might not necessarily be in the right direction. The passage of the US GENIUS Act has been widely hailed as a major milestone for stablecoin adoption, but a controversial provision in the bill is drawing a lot of criticism for potentially limiting the appeal of digital dollars. The legislation bans stablecoin issuers from offering yield-bearing versions of their tokens. This move effectively prevents both retail and institutional holders from earning interest on digital dollar holdings. Critics argue that this plays into the hands of the traditional banking sector, which has long relied on controlling yield opportunities for depositors. Trump signs GENIUS Act (Source: Fox News ) Temujin Louie , CEO of crosschain protocol Wanchain, warned that the GENIUS Act may not be the unqualified win it seems to be. He pointed out that by prohibiting yield, the bill gives a competitive edge to tokenized money market funds, which are very quickly turning into Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins. JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho explained the potential of tokenized MMFs to serve as margin collateral and fulfill other use cases that were traditionally served by stablecoins. Louie agrees with this, and said that tokenization grants MMFs the speed and flexibility previously unique to stablecoins, while also preserving regulatory oversight. Paul Brody , global blockchain leader at EY, pointed out that tokenized MMFs and deposits could thrive in this new environment, since they can provide yield while functioning similarly to stablecoins. However, Brody added that stablecoins still maintain an edge in DeFi integration, thanks to their bearer asset nature, which allows easy use across decentralized platforms. If tokenized MMFs come with too many restrictions, their yield advantage might not be enough to win over users. The banking industry’s influence over the legislation has been a strong point of concern for many. Reports from earlier this year revealed that financial institutions were actively lobbying to block yield-bearing stablecoins, as they see them as a threat to their business model. NYU professor Austin Campbell shared that banks, having offered minimal interest for decades, fear losing ground if stablecoin issuers can provide yield directly to consumers. Despite the restrictions in the GENIUS Act, yield-bearing digital assets are not entirely absent from the US market. In February, the SEC approved the first yield-bearing stablecoin security, YLDS, issued by Figure Markets. It launched with a 3.85% yield. This means that there is a lot of potential for yield in tokenized assets, albeit under stricter securities regulations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,financial time osborne explained uk risk losing status financial leader u advance initiative like genius act osborne criticized chancellor rachel reef supported coinbase controversial ad campaign mocked uk economic stagnation pointed crypto alternative meanwhile genius act scrutiny u banning stablecoins critic say favor traditional bank undermines stablecoin innovation expert argue tokenized money market fund may benefit stablecoins still hold edge defi uk missing crypto opportunity george osborne former uk chancellor adviser coinbase issued stark warning united kingdom falling behind digital asset race particularly stablecoin sector recent financial time osborne voiced concern uk sluggish progress adopting policy argued country risk squandering position global financial leader george osborne criticized government inaction especially regard stablecoins see essential tool reducing friction global finance osborne stated u forging ahead initiative like genius act cement dollar dominance stablecoin space uk risk irrelevance warned british pound one world traded currency may even play supporting role digital economy current trend continue osborne critique aimed part current chancellor rachel reef accused failing deliver promise support innovation digital currency sector comment made controversial ad campaign coinbase titled everything fine satirical musical piece mock uk economic stagnation crisis according coinbase ceo brian armstrong ad banned uk television network suggests traditional financial system broken point crypto modern alternative ad ban could independently verified cnbc nevertheless led debate drew attention coinbase growing lobbying effort uk coinbase entered uk market aggressive force shaping crypto regulation particularly true u spent lobbying crypto firm according politico opensecrets osborne company latest campaign indicate renewed push influence policy britain critic question genius act motif u making progress genius act might necessarily right direction passage u genius act widely hailed major milestone stablecoin adoption controversial provision bill drawing lot criticism potentially limiting appeal digital dollar legislation ban stablecoin issuer offering version token move effectively prevents retail institutional holder earning interest digital dollar holding critic argue play hand traditional banking sector long relied controlling yield opportunity depositor trump sign genius act source fox news temujin louie ceo crosschain protocol wanchain warned genius act may unqualified win seems pointed prohibiting yield bill give competitive edge tokenized money market fund quickly turning wall street answer stablecoins jpmorgan strategist teresa ho explained potential tokenized mmfs serve margin collateral fulfill use case traditionally served stablecoins louie agrees said tokenization grant mmfs speed flexibility previously unique stablecoins also preserving regulatory oversight paul brody global blockchain leader ey pointed tokenized mmfs deposit could thrive new environment since provide yield functioning similarly stablecoins however brody added stablecoins still maintain edge defi integration thanks bearer asset nature allows easy use across decentralized platform tokenized mmfs come many restriction yield advantage might enough win user banking industry influence legislation strong point concern many report earlier year revealed financial institution actively lobbying block stablecoins see threat business model nyu professor austin campbell shared bank offered minimal interest decade fear losing ground stablecoin issuer provide yield directly consumer despite restriction genius act digital asset entirely absent u market february sec approved first stablecoin security ylds issued figure market launched yield mean lot potential yield tokenized asset albeit stricter security regulation,0.162,0.646,0.192,0.9657,1

SOL climbed above the $160 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $162 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $182 swing high to the $155 low. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $165 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $170 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $182 swing high to the $155 low. The next major resistance is near the $172 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $182. Any more gains might send the price toward the $192 level. Are Downsides Supported In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $165 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $162 level. A break below the $162 level might send the price toward the $155 support zone. If there is a close below the $150 support, the price could decline toward the $145 support in the near term.

2025-08-05 05:28:08,49563858,1754371688,Korean Analyst States: “This Level in Bitcoin is Like a Very Strong Magnet”,"Cryptocurrency analyst Min Tae-yoon has published a compelling analysis of the Bitcoin (BTC) price. According to Tae-yoon, BTC has reentered the classic “Triple Power” market structure, and as this structure nears its distribution phase, a break above $120,000 could trigger rapid upward momentum. Last weekend, Bitcoin's price fell to $112,000, a decline that some analysts believe could have triggered a “position reset” and paved the way for a rally. Tae-yoon argues that this correction could actually pave the way for a new upward move. The “Power of 3” model describes a three-stage market structure: “accumulation – manipulation – distribution.” This structure is particularly used to analyze the liquidity movements of institutional investors and is often preferred to understand the delayed reactions of individual investors. Related News: Donald Trump to Make Two Critical Appointments in the Next Few Days - Could Affect Markets, Here Are the Details According to the analysis, Bitcoin established a solid base in the $115,300-$119,500 range during the accumulation phase. The subsequent sudden drop dragged the price down to $112,000. This movement is generally interpreted as the liquidation of individual investors who bought at the peak and the creation of a new accumulation base in the market. One of the most striking points in Tae-yoon's analysis is that the $120,000 level acts as a “powerful price magnet.” If the price reaches and sustains above $115,300 and $116,800, Bitcoin could break through the $120,000 resistance and rapidly rally to the technical target of $126,000. It's estimated that $922 million worth of leveraged positions were liquidated during the recent correction. Position resets of this scale typically reduce market overheating and pave the way for a new rally. *This is not investment advice.

The company recently announced its groundbreaking Jetking Bitcoin strategy , becoming the first publicly traded Indian entity to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as its primary Bitcoin treasury reserve . This bold step marks a significant moment for Indian crypto adoption and could inspire many others. Jetking’s Ambitious BTC Accumulation Plan Takes Shape Jetking’s commitment to Bitcoin is not just symbolic; it is a meticulously planned financial pivot. As of May 2025, the company already holds 21 BTC. However, this is merely the beginning of their ambitious journey. Short-term Goal: Jetking plans to accumulate 210 BTC by the end of 2025. Long-term Vision: The ultimate target is an impressive 18,000 BTC by the year 2030. To fuel this aggressive BTC accumulation plan , Jetking successfully raised 17.6 crore rupees through two strategic equity rounds this year. This financial backing demonstrates serious intent behind their digital asset play. Why Embrace a Bitcoin Treasury Reserve? A Strategic Imperative You might wonder why an Indian IT education firm would venture so deeply into cryptocurrency. The answer lies in a proactive approach to economic uncertainties. Jetking aims to hedge against the persistent threats of inflation and the depreciation of fiat currency. This strategy mirrors that of U.S.-based MicroStrategy, a company renowned for its substantial corporate Bitcoin holdings . By holding Bitcoin, Jetking seeks to preserve and potentially grow its capital in a decentralized, inflation-resistant asset. It is a forward-thinking decision designed to safeguard the company’s future financial stability. Navigating India’s Complex Crypto Landscape Jetking’s pivot is particularly remarkable given India’s stringent cryptocurrency regulations. The nation has historically maintained a cautious stance on digital assets, with ongoing discussions about their legal framework. Despite these hurdles, Jetking has forged ahead, proving that strategic innovation can thrive even in challenging environments. The market has responded positively to this audacious move. Since announcing its crypto adoption, Jetking’s stock has surged by more than 135%. This significant increase indicates investor confidence in the company’s new direction and its potential for long-term growth, perhaps signaling a shift in perception towards Indian crypto adoption . What Does This Bold BTC Accumulation Plan Mean for India? Jetking’s pioneering Jetking Bitcoin strategy could set a precedent for other Indian corporations. Their success in navigating regulatory complexities and demonstrating the financial benefits of a Bitcoin treasury reserve might encourage more businesses to explore similar ventures. It highlights a growing trend of companies looking beyond traditional assets for value preservation and growth. The ambition to accumulate 18,000 BTC by 2030 positions Jetking not just as a participant, but as a potential leader in the global movement towards corporate Bitcoin holdings . This long-term vision emphasizes Bitcoin’s role as a robust store of value and a viable component of corporate balance sheets. In conclusion, Jetking Infotrain’s decision to embrace Bitcoin as a core treasury asset is a landmark event for India and the global crypto space.

2025-08-05 05:24:52,49563719,1754371492,New Executive Order to Punish US Banks for Dropping Crypto Customers,"The White House order will involve banks being fined if they drop customers for political reasons or discriminate against digital asset firms and organizations. The executive order directs bank regulators to investigate whether any banks or financial institutions might have violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws, or consumer financial protection laws, reported The Wall Street Journal on Monday. The order threatens monetary penalties, consent decrees, and other disciplinary measures for violators and could be signed this week, the report added. Big Banks Can’t Discriminate Against Crypto “Cryptocurrency companies have said they were shut out of banking services under the Biden administration,” the report noted, though the order also includes being debanked on political grounds. White House preparing executive order that would punish banks that discriminate against crypto companies… via @dgtokar @ajsaeedy pic.twitter.com/XQrlUuWsC1 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 4, 2025 The banks claim their decisions are based on legal, regulatory, and financial risks, particularly anti-money laundering compliance, which has a wide scope, granting them a lot of control over people’s assets. “We’ve provided detailed proposals and will continue to work with the administration and Congress to improve the regulatory framework,” a Bank of America spokesman told the outlet. Banking regulators under Trump have already stopped assessing “reputational risk” from customers, which was seen as a boost for the crypto industry. The move represents a significant shift from Biden-era banking oversight under Operation Chokepoint 2.0, with the Trump administration positioning itself as the protector of crypto interests against alleged financial industry bias. There have been several cases in recent years where crypto industry experts or companies have been debanked, and the Trump administration clearly wants to put an end to this practice. JPMorgan Chase informed Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in December 2023 that they would close accounts of individuals whose primary income stemmed from crypto. Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, also said that JPMorgan told him they would close the accounts of anyone whose primary source of income or wealth was crypto. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, and the Bitcoin Foundation’s Charlie Shrem also said they were debanked. In November 2024, Elon Musk posted evidence that 30 tech founders were debanked under the Biden administration. Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked? https://t.co/gmnCir43XD — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 27, 2024 Banks Still Hate Crypto It is no surprise that banks harbor a lot of disdain against decentralized digital assets and companies that are part of the nascent industry. Banks profit from lending out their customers’ money and impose high levels of control and restrictions on what customers can and cannot do with their own money. Crypto is the complete antithesis of this, enabling peer-to-peer transfers and freedom over finances. Now that banks can see big profits in stablecoins, they appear to be warming to the industry (but for the wrong reasons).

2025-08-05 05:22:06,49563973,1754371326,Banks face pressure from crypto and conservative groups,"The White House is gearing up to issue a sweeping executive order aimed at cracking down on banks accused of discriminating against conservative organizations and cryptocurrency businesses. A draft of the order, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, reveals that financial institutions could face stiff penalties for denying services based on political affiliations or ties to the crypto industry. The directive would require federal regulators to investigate potential violations of key laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust regulations, and consumer protection statutes. Banks in breach could be subject to fines, lawsuits, or compelled to enter legally binding agreements to reform their practices. While the order could be signed early this week, sources say the timeline remains fluid amid internal administration deliberations. If finalized, the move would signal a significant step by the Trump-aligned administration to safeguard banking access for groups it believes are being unjustly excluded—particularly conservatives and crypto-related entities. Banks face pressure from crypto and conservative groups For years, many conservative organizations and cryptocurrency-related companies have claimed that banks have closed their accounts or denied them financial services for political or ideological reasons. Some groups say they were flagged or dropped simply for holding conservative beliefs. Others in the crypto industry claim banks cut them off to avoid regulatory pressure, even if no laws were broken. One high-profile case, which is indirectly referenced in the draft order, involved Bank of America. The bank reportedly shut down accounts from a Christian group operating in Uganda. The organization accused the bank of targeting them for religious reasons. However, Bank of America responded that the decision was based on policy, not politics. The bank said it does not serve small businesses operating outside the U.S. as a matter of standard practice. The draft order also criticizes banks for their role in sharing customer data with law enforcement during the January 6 Capitol riot investigation. Some banks voluntarily flagged customer transactions or activity they believed were linked to the event. Supporters of the executive order say this sets a dangerous precedent where banks may act as political gatekeepers. Meanwhile, crypto companies have faced a long struggle to access banking services. Under the Biden administration , several firms have complained of being shut out from traditional banking due to what they call a “shadow ban” by regulators. Banks, on the other hand, argue that they are responding to legitimate compliance risks, especially when dealing with digital assets, which have been linked to fraud and money laundering. Many cite U.S. anti-money-laundering laws and a lack of clear guidance as reasons for caution. Banks act to avoid regulatory crackdown Over the past few months, several major financial institutions have updated their internal policies to clarify that they do not discriminate based on political belief or affiliation. Others have held meetings with Republican attorneys general to reassure them of their commitment to fairness. A spokesperson for Bank of America said the institution welcomes efforts by the administration to bring greater clarity to the rules. “We’ve provided detailed proposals and will continue to work with the administration and Congress to improve the regulatory framework,” he said. The draft executive order also includes new instructions for federal agencies. It calls on banking regulators to eliminate existing policies that may have encouraged banks to consider “reputational risk” when deciding whether to work with certain customers. Banks often use reputational risk to avoid business with politically sensitive or high-risk industries. This practice has been controversial. Critics argue it gives banks too much power to act as moral or political judges. Regulators under the Trump administration had previously said they would avoid using reputational risk as a standard. In addition, the draft order tells the Small Business Administration (SBA) to review how participating banks treat loan applicants—especially when those banks guarantee SBA-backed loans. This could affect thousands of small businesses that rely on federal support. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-08-05 05:20:00,49563972,1754371200,Remittix (RTX) and Ethereum (ETH) Set To Crush Cardano (ADA) In The 2025 Bull Market,"The recent cooldown in the broader market saw the Ethereum price drop to $3,390 before bulls managed to push the asset back near $3,570. The influx of investor capital into ETH’s ecosystem through Ethereum hasn’t slowed down, a sign that analysts view as a positive signal for market stability. Meanwhile, there is a Remittix (RTX) , an ETH-based utility token developed to cater to low-cost and direct cross-border settlements. This new crypto project has become a fan favorite among natives who look forward to its 100x growth potential. Analysts believe both projects will deliver investors more profits than Cardano this cycle. ADA followed a similar price trajectory to Ethereum in the last 48 hours, but what’s next for the asset this quarter? Let’s answer this question, but before that, we will discuss Ethereum price action and what you need to know about Remitix. Institutional Demand is Likely to Drive Ethereum Price Higher Major corporate entities are increasing their ETH holdings, fueling the chances of an imminent breakout. BitMine Immersion, for example, has raked in about $2.9 billion worth of Ethereum ( i.e., over 833,000 tokens ), making it the largest public Ethereum treasury holder as of today. Besides, Ethereum ETFs saw continuous inflows, including a 17-day streak of net inflows, with $65.14 million added in a single day, and BlackRock’s ETHA pushing $131.95 million in late July. It’s safe to say that despite the recent Ethereum price slip, institutional appetite is still on. Source: X Over the past 30 days, Ethereum price rallied over 44.5% to approximately $3,600, with analysts now targeting a breakout above $4,100, especially if there is continued institutional activity and ETF interest. Cardano (ADA): A Golden Cross, But Challenges Ahead Cardano followed a similar price trajectory to Ethereum price in the past week, bleeding for 5 successive days, before a 9.31% jump in the next 48 hours. As of today, Cardano buys and sells at $0.7521, with 24‑hour volume around $760 million, up 4.5% on the day but down 6.8% week to date. A few analysts are looking at a bearish outlook for ADA, with a Fear & Greed Index at 54 (Greed). Cardano recently formed its first-ever weekly golden cross, where the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week average; a bullish argument others are citing. However, ADA must reclaim levels above $0.8–$0.86 to maintain momentum; else, a slip below $0.69 could be next. Remittix Should Be Your Next Bet Remittix (RTX) is an Ethereum-layer token designed to tackle inefficient cross-border payments using low-cost on-chain rails. Built to serve global users from freelancers to SMEs and remitters, this payment network delivers instant, transparent crypto-to-fiat transfers without reliance on centralized exchanges. Remittix is well on track to be one of the best cryptos to buy this cycle. Here are other things you need to know: Remittix will support conversion within a range of 40+ crypto assets and 30+ fiat currencies at launch, making it usable from anywhere in the world. It allows real‑time FX conversion with fully transparent rates, meaning there are no hidden fees or surprise deductions. RTX will close on a 190T market gap.

2025-08-05 05:00:37,49563385,1754370037,Cold Wallet Rewards Every Transaction And Raises $5.6M As Presale Price Climbs Toward Explosive Launch ROI,"Some presales speak for themselves with the numbers. Cold Wallet’s CWT now sells for $0.00924, with an expected listing at $0.3517. That’s a potential 3,633% gain before any post‑launch growth. The concept behind Cold Wallet (CWT) is simple yet game‑changing, a wallet that rewards every transaction. With $5.6 million already raised and 15 stages gone almost instantly, demand shows no signs of slowing. It is not about proving if the model works; the real question is how much profit is left for those still watching. Every stage that sells pushes the buy‑in higher, trimming the returns for those who delay while the market quickly locks in positions. Cold Wallet Solves Crypto Most Expensive Fee Problem Crypto wallets have long felt like hidden fee collectors. Every transfer takes a cut , gas, swaps, bridges, even converting to fiat. Cold Wallet changes this with one bold idea: transactions should grow balances, not drain them. Powered by CWT, Cold Wallet turns daily usage into earnings. Cashback comes from sending, rebates from swapping, and rewards even for moving money in or out. With 15 presale stages already gone and over $5.6 million secured, CWT is gaining strong market attention. A major push came from acquiring Plus Wallet for $270 million, adding over two million active users before launch. This move sets Cold Wallet apart, driving adoption faster than expected and making it one of the most anticipated names in the current crypto scene. Whales Buy Fast Every Stage Reduces Future ROI Cold Wallet’s presale is attracting serious capital. Large buyers are securing millions of CWT early, speeding up sellouts beyond initial forecasts. Stage 15 was gone in hours, and Stage 16 is quickly running low. Since the start, the price has already climbed more than 34%. Each completed stage narrows the gap between the entry cost and the fixed listing price of $0.3517, cutting future returns for late entrants. Those entering at the current $0.00924 mark still face a projected 3,633% upside, yet the opportunity shrinks with every stage gone. Watching stages vanish in real time is a clear signal that hesitation comes at a high cost in this fast‑moving presale cycle. Price Forecast Suggests Bigger Story After Launch The crypto presale numbers alone are striking a 3,633% return at launch for Stage 16 entries if CWT reaches $0.3517. Yet, many analysts think this is just the start. Market discussions in private groups already speculate on post‑launch prices climbing toward $5 or even $10. At $0.00924, even a small rise toward these targets could turn a modest stake into life‑changing figures. The data is already visible for those who check the numbers, but the clock runs with every stage sold. The shrinking ROI with each increase in entry price is pushing early participation as the clear strategy before CWT hits public trading. One Thousand Dollar Stake Could Bring Thirty Seven Thousand Numbers tell the full picture. At $0.00924, a $1,000 stake secures over 108,000 CWT. If the coin meets its estimated launch value of $0.3517, that same stake becomes more than $37,000 before any post‑launch movement.If CWT reached $5, the stake would exceed half a million dollars. At $10, it would pass $1 million. While these are projections, not guarantees, they explain why early stages draw heavy demand. Every new stage raises the price and reduces future gains. Many are stepping in now to capture maximum upside, leaving hesitation as the main reason others may watch opportunity slip away before launch. Conclusion At $0.00924, CWT offers an expected 3,633% ROI by launch , already less than it was just days ago. Stage 15 sold out in a flash, Stage 16 is depleting fast, and the ROI continues to shrink with each allocation claimed. The market’s response is clear: $5.6 million already secured and growing because CWT is seen as one of the top opportunities right now. A $1,000 stake today could be $37,000 at launch. Miss this stage, and the price rises while gains fall. Such clear, near‑term potential is rare in crypto, and missing it is the kind of story that gets told for years.

2025-08-05 05:00:09,49563384,1754370009,"Best Altcoins to Buy for Next Bull Run: BlockDAG, TAO, RENDER, NEAR Lead the Way","Crypto is heating up again as key projects show fresh momentum. The top altcoins to buy for the next bull run aren’t just hype plays; they come with real features, active platforms, and growing user bases. BlockDAG has pulled ahead with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, now offering BDAG at just $0.0016, with a 3,025% ROI possible if it hits the $0.05 launch price. At the same time, Bittensor (TAO) gains strength through institutional backing. Render (RENDER) is building GPU infrastructure on Solana, and NEAR Protocol is deepening DeFi through Cardano integrations. All four projects offer something unique: AI, graphics, cross-chain swaps, and a live trading simulator. But only one offers access at ground-floor pricing, BlockDAG . 1. BlockDAG: $361M Raised, GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Offer Ending Soon BlockDAG is making fast progress in 2025. It has raised $361 million and sold over 24.7 billion coins. While the standard Batch 29 price is $0.0276, a special offer under the GLOBAL LAUNCH release has unlocked a limited $0.0016 entry price. This deal is live until August 11. After that, the price returns to its actual batch rate. For those who get in now, the difference is big. The listing price is confirmed at $0.05, setting up a projected 3,025% ROI from the GLOBAL LAUNCH release price and 2,660% from Batch 1. BlockDAG isn’t just collecting funds. It’s delivering. Its Demo Trading Exchange is already live, letting users experience BDAG trading in real time. Both buying and demo selling functions are active. Every BDAG purchase also qualifies for the 10 BTC Auction Pool. This reward model is based on how much a user buys, not luck, making it more fair and direct. Outside trading, BlockDAG’s X1 miner app is already being used by more than 2.5 million people. Its architecture combines DAG technology with Proof-of-Work to allow fast, scalable processing without the usual blockchain delays. All of these points position BlockDAG (BDAG) as the best altcoin to buy for the next bull run. It’s already built, already live, and already rewarding users. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release ends August 11. After that, the low $0.0016 entry closes for good. That’s why BDAG continues to rise to the top of analyst lists, and why many see it as the most promising project to hold in 2025. 2. Bittensor (TAO): AI Growth and Institutional Entry Bittensor (TAO) has started attracting strong attention this quarter. A major wallet recently staked 41,500 TAO—worth about $15.4 million- across Subtensor’s validator layer. This makes up 4% of TAO’s circulating supply and is earning close to 10% APY. That kind of long-term staking shows clear confidence from institutional players. Validators are increasing across the network, especially in subnet clusters, which has improved uptime and decentralisation. At the same time, emissions are being absorbed quickly by delegation, so there’s no dump pressure visible on-chain. TAO is shaping up to be more than just an AI concept. It’s turning into a full utility network focused on building a decentralised AI compute layer. With more tools going live and big money entering, TAO is now among the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. 3. Render (RENDER): Solana GPU Power Gains Demand Render (RENDER) is moving fast. Built natively on Solana, it’s now being featured by exchanges like OKX and has grown its reach through GPU-based computing. With 517 million coins in circulation and a deflationary Burn-and-Mint system, RENDER keeps its supply controlled while supporting growing demand. The project is gaining real-world use with 3D graphics rendering, AI model training, and creative tools like OctaneRender. It’s even attracting interest from studios looking for cheaper, decentralised cloud alternatives. As GPU use increases across sectors, RENDER is catching attention beyond crypto circles. Its platform is functional, scalable, and already integrated with multiple industries. That utility, combined with its tight tokenomics, makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. 4. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): ADA Integration and Buy Pressure NEAR Protocol is showing clear signs of revival. Two key events pushed it back into analyst focus. First, NEAR launched a pilot with Cardano to allow trustless swaps of ADA using its Intents framework. This uses smart contracts like cardano.omft.near to carry out the swaps. Second, NEAR saw a sharp increase in trading activity, with volume up over 3% and price rising 3% in just one day. This followed increased interest from institutional buyers. The NEAR Intents platform has handled nearly $1 billion in total swap value and supports over 100 assets. This shows that NEAR’s settlement layer is catching on. With its unique AI sharding model and DeFi push, NEAR is regaining traction and looks like one of the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. Final Thoughts on the Top Crypto Picks for the Next Bull Run The altcoin market is quickly sorting winners from talkers. TAO’s AI infrastructure, RENDER’s GPU platform, and NEAR’s DeFi push each have strong futures. But BlockDAG brings something rare, real progress, live features, and 3,025% ROI upside through its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With $361 million raised, 24.7 billion coins sold, and a current $0.0016 price active only until August 11, BDAG offers unmatched value in this cycle. While others are scaling, BlockDAG is already operating. Its tools are live. Its rewards are flowing. That’s why it remains the top pick for those scanning the space for the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run.

2025-08-05 04:59:48,49563562,1754369988,"Summer’s top 3 high-potential tokens, only one still under $0.05","Built for practicality, powered by purpose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) won’t follow the noise—it will answer real market demands. The platform will operate on a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending structure that will allow users to contribute blue-chip assets like ADA, BNB, or SOL into smart contract-based pools to earn yield. On the borrowing side, users will be able to stake BTC and instantly unlock USDT or USDC at up to 75% loan-to-value. This model will give investors both stability and flexibility. For those looking to personalize their lending experience, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also provide a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) option. This feature will let individuals set customized terms—ideal for risk-managed trades or for leveraging high-risk tokens in the crypto ecosystem like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP, and BONK. The approach will blend passive income with customizable borrowing strategies, creating a truly user-centric lending marketplace. Additionally, Layer-2 blockchain integration will significantly reduce transaction costs, enhancing user efficiency without compromising decentralization. This technical advantage will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) far more accessible than legacy DeFi protocols still dependent on expensive Layer-1 gas models. Limited-time price, high-level traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale with tokens available at just $0.035. Out of the allocated 170 million tokens for this round, 10% are already taken up, with over $14 million raised to date. The low presale price offers entry below the $0.06 planned listing, giving buyers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a platform gearing up for strong momentum. The project’s credibility is supported by a thorough CertiK audit, including a 95 Token Scan score and a 78 Skynet score—both strong indicators of security and technical soundness. These scores reflect a well-audited smart contract framework and a roadmap that is already showing signs of serious execution. Adding to the community buzz is a $100,000 token giveaway —10 winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, giving thousands of participants a direct incentive to get involved. With over 14,900 holders and 12,000+ Twitter followers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction not just for its pricing, but also for its transparent operations and engaged community. Forecasts that turn heads, investments already paying off Experienced analysts are beginning to weigh in—and the expectations are substantial. One well-known market analyst, who made headlines in 2020 for correctly predicting XRP’s breakout, is now calling for a 20x rise in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as early as mid-2025. The reasoning is grounded in fundamentals: a decentralized stablecoin in development, real passive yield for lenders, and an integrated staking system that loops value back to long-term users. Already, some investors are reaping early benefits. One Phase 1 participant who swapped $3,000 in MATIC for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.01 is now holding tokens worth over $10,000—even before the official launch. With the token set to list at $0.06 and long-term targets approaching $1, these early positions are turning heads in investor circles. As whales start rotating out of large-cap positions in ETH, BTC, and AVAX in search of asymmetric upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly showing up on watchlists and wallets alike. The only undervalued contender left this summer Most of the summer’s top token picks have already taken off—many of them now out of reach for the average investor. But with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still priced under $0.05, it’s one of the last legitimate opportunities to enter a serious project at an early stage. With just 90% of Phase 6 tokens remaining and a scheduled 15% price jump to $0.040 in Phase 7, the current entry point won’t last much longer. Once listing happens, and especially as the Beta platform goes live, visibility and user demand are expected to climb significantly. Further exchange listings on major platforms like Binance, KuCoin, or Coinbase are likely to accelerate that growth, unlocking more exposure and bringing retail investors into the fold. Summer in crypto is usually filled with FOMO. For once, that fear might be justified. While others are buying tokens at peak valuations, investors who take action now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are positioning themselves at the front of the next breakout curve.

2025-08-05 04:57:06,49563561,1754369826,Best crypto to buy as ADA drops 2.4% as bearish momentum dominates?,"Consequently, investors are examining alternatives, seeking assets with stronger momentum and clearer growth paths amidst this crypto crash. This search makes identifying the best crypto to buy now crucial. Cardano faces technical and adoption hurdles Cardano confronts significant technical headwinds. Its price sits below key EMAs, including the 20, 50, and 100-period averages, signaling persistent weakness. The aspect of the three key interest areas is on the indicators. The DMI indicator exhibits that the -DI is well in the lead with 31.8 against a weak +DI line with 9.6, ascertaining the strength of the bearish trend indeed. Besides, the Bollinger Bands have expanded drastically to the lower side with the price of ADA below the lower band, thus an indicator of increased volatility on the selling side. Therefore, ADA’s near-term recovery depends heavily on holding the $0.68 support zone and overcoming the $0.78 resistance, a difficult task under current crypto prices. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates past $14 million Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates exceptional presale traction, directly contrasting Cardano’s struggles. Investors have contributed over $14,000,000 since the presale began. More than 665 million MUTM tokens have been sold to 14,800 holders. Phase 6 is currently underway, offering tokens at $0.035. This price represents a substantial 250% increase from the opening phase cost of $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, meaning the chance to acquire tokens at this discounted rate is ending soon. Consequently, the subsequent phase will see a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch officially at $0.06. Buying at the current Phase 6 price guarantees a minimum 71% return on investment at launch, making it a standout crypto investment opportunity. Robust security underpins Mutuum Finance project Security forms a critical pillar for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project team has successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit. This rigorous assessment yielded an outstanding 95.00 security score, reflecting a solid security posture. Complementing this, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is allocated, split across four tiers based on vulnerability severity: Critical vulnerabilities Major vulnerabilities Minor vulnerabilities Low severity issues This proactive approach incentivizes continuous scrutiny and enhances platform safety for all users. Also, the project introduced a new dashboard complete with a leaderboard that monitors the top 50 holders of the token. These top owners will obtain bonuses in token form to continue occupying these positions, which promotes long-term investment. Compelling value proposition and future potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility beyond speculative trading. Its core involves building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform operating efficiently on Layer-2 technology. The dual-lending model caters to diverse risk appetites, incorporating both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. P2C allows tokenizing major assets like BTC or ETH to earn interest, while P2P facilitates direct lending agreements, potentially offering higher yields. Tokenomics drive inherent value: the fixed 4 billion token supply faces increasing demand pressure as platform usage grows. Based on its fundamentals and market positioning, post-launch targets reaching $1.50 appear achievable, translating to massive gains for Phase 6 investors. This potential makes it a compelling candidate for the best crypto to buy now, especially compared to assets like ADA facing strong bearish headwinds. Actionable opportunity amidst market volatility While Cardano wrestles with bearish technicals and adoption speed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a demonstrably different trajectory. For investors seeking assets with strong momentum and fundamental utility during this period of crypto market uncertainty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a timely and strategic crypto investment.

2025-08-05 04:55:10,49562480,1754369710,Indian Rupee’s Alarming Plunge: Trump Tariff Threat Triggers Economic Fallout,"BitcoinWorld Indian Rupee’s Alarming Plunge: Trump Tariff Threat Triggers Economic Fallout In the dynamic world of finance, where digital assets often grab headlines, the foundational shifts in traditional currency markets continue to hold immense significance. The recent news of the Indian Rupee hitting a record low against the US Dollar, primarily triggered by the escalating Trump Tariff threat, serves as a stark reminder of how geopolitical tensions can send immediate ripples through global economies. For those accustomed to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, understanding the forces that sway fiat currencies like the Rupee provides crucial context for the broader financial ecosystem, highlighting the interconnectedness of all financial instruments, from decentralized digital currencies to established national tenders. What Triggered the Indian Rupee’s Alarming Decline? The Indian Rupee found itself in unprecedented territory, plumbing new depths against the mighty US Dollar. This alarming decline was not an isolated event but rather a direct consequence of mounting global trade tensions, specifically the renewed threats of tariffs from the United States under the then-Trump administration. When the US signaled its intent to impose tariffs on goods from various countries, including key trading partners, it sent a jolt through international markets. Investors, seeking safety amidst the uncertainty, began to pull capital from riskier, growth-oriented economies like India and park it in perceived safe-haven assets, predominantly the US Dollar. This sudden flight of capital created a surge in demand for the dollar, inevitably weakening currencies like the Rupee. The mechanism is straightforward: when foreign investors sell their Indian assets (stocks, bonds) to move their money elsewhere, they convert their Rupees into dollars, increasing the supply of Rupees and the demand for dollars. This imbalance directly contributes to the currency depreciation . Furthermore, the fear of a looming global trade war also dampened export prospects for India, reducing potential dollar inflows and exacerbating the Rupee’s woes. The sentiment of economic uncertainty alone can trigger significant market movements, as seen in the rapid devaluation of the Indian Rupee . Understanding the Trump Tariff Threat and its Global Ripple Effects The concept of the Trump Tariff threat emerged from an ‘America First’ economic policy, which sought to protect domestic industries through the imposition of import duties. Initially targeting steel and aluminum, these tariffs quickly expanded to include a wider range of goods, particularly from China, igniting fears of a full-blown Global Trade War . The rationale behind these tariffs was to reduce trade deficits and encourage domestic production, but their immediate effect was widespread market instability and retaliation from affected countries. The global ripple effects were immediate and far-reaching: Disruption of Supply Chains: Companies that rely on international sourcing faced increased costs, forcing them to either absorb losses, pass costs to consumers, or rethink their global manufacturing strategies. Investor Uncertainty: The unpredictable nature of tariff announcements created a climate of fear, leading investors to shy away from long-term commitments in volatile markets. Retaliatory Measures: Countries affected by US tariffs often responded with their own tariffs on American goods, escalating the trade conflict and harming exporters on both sides. Slowing Global Growth: Reduced international trade, coupled with diminished business confidence, threatened to put a brake on global economic expansion, impacting demand for goods and services worldwide. This protectionist stance, while intended to benefit one nation, inadvertently created significant headwinds for the global economy, directly influencing the stability of various currencies, including the Indian Rupee . Why Does Currency Depreciation Matter for India? For a net importing nation like India, significant currency depreciation carries substantial economic consequences. When the Indian Rupee weakens against the US Dollar, it means that India has to pay more Rupees for every dollar’s worth of imports. Given India’s heavy reliance on imported crude oil, electronics, and machinery, this translates directly into higher import bills. The immediate implications for India include: Inflationary Pressure: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to an increase in domestic prices for goods and services. This can erode purchasing power and impact household budgets. Increased Debt Burden: Many Indian companies and the government have borrowed in foreign currencies, particularly the US Dollar. A weaker Rupee makes it more expensive to service and repay these dollar-denominated debts, potentially straining corporate balance sheets and public finances. Impact on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): While a weaker Rupee might make Indian assets cheaper for foreign investors, the underlying economic instability caused by currency depreciation can deter new FDI, as investors prefer stable and predictable markets. Travel and Education Costs: For Indian citizens planning to travel abroad or send their children for overseas education, the cost in Rupees significantly increases, making international experiences less accessible. While a weaker currency can theoretically boost exports by making them cheaper for foreign buyers, the context of a Global Trade War often means that overall global demand might be shrinking, negating much of this potential benefit. Thus, the currency depreciation of the Indian Rupee presents a net challenge for the nation’s economic stability. The Broader Implications for Emerging Markets The challenges faced by the Indian Rupee are often symptomatic of broader vulnerabilities within Emerging Markets . These economies, characterized by rapid growth but often less developed financial systems and higher external debt, are particularly susceptible to global economic shocks and shifts in investor sentiment. When a major economy like the US initiates protectionist policies or raises interest rates, it can trigger a ‘contagion effect’ across the entire emerging market landscape. Key implications for Emerging Markets include: Challenge Explanation Capital Flight Investors pull funds from perceived riskier emerging market assets and move them to safer havens like US Treasury bonds, leading to currency depreciation and stock market declines. Increased Borrowing Costs As foreign capital exits, emerging market governments and companies find it more expensive to borrow, either domestically or internationally, stifling investment and growth. Imported Inflation Similar to India, reliance on imports means that weaker local currencies make essential goods, including energy and raw materials, more expensive, fueling inflation. Policy Dilemmas Central banks face a tough choice: raise interest rates to defend the currency (potentially hurting domestic growth) or allow the currency to depreciate further (risking inflation and debt issues). The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that a Trump Tariff threat, while aimed at specific trade imbalances, can create a ripple effect that destabilizes currencies and economies far beyond the direct targets, making the resilience of Emerging Markets a critical concern for global economic stability. Navigating the Global Trade War: Challenges and Potential Responses The specter of a Global Trade War presents complex challenges for policymakers worldwide, especially for countries like India that are deeply integrated into global supply chains. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies makes it difficult for businesses to plan and invest, potentially leading to reduced economic activity. Governments and central banks are left with a difficult balancing act, trying to mitigate the immediate impacts while also fostering long-term resilience. Potential responses and challenges include: Monetary Policy Tools: Central banks, like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), may consider interventions in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the Indian Rupee . However, such interventions can deplete foreign exchange reserves. Raising interest rates to attract capital is another option, but it risks slowing down domestic economic growth. Fiscal Measures: Governments might implement fiscal stimulus packages or provide support to industries most affected by tariffs to cushion the blow. However, this could strain public finances. Diversification of Trade Partners: Countries might actively seek to diversify their trade relationships, reducing reliance on specific markets that are prone to protectionist policies. This involves exploring new export markets and sourcing alternatives for critical imports. Strengthening Domestic Demand: Focusing on boosting internal consumption and investment can help offset the negative impacts of reduced international trade. Advocacy for Multilateralism: Engaging in international forums and advocating for open, rules-based trade systems remains crucial to counter protectionist tendencies and prevent a full-blown Global Trade War . The long-term economic outlook for countries caught in the crossfire depends heavily on their ability to adapt to changing global trade dynamics and implement sound economic policies that foster stability and growth despite external pressures. The experience of the Indian Rupee during this period underscores the critical need for robust economic frameworks in an increasingly unpredictable global landscape. The episode of the Indian Rupee hitting a record low due to the Trump Tariff threat serves as a powerful case study in the intricate dance between geopolitics, trade, and currency markets. It underscores how decisions made in one part of the world can have immediate and profound consequences across the globe, particularly for vulnerable Emerging Markets . The resulting currency depreciation highlights the challenges faced by nations striving for economic stability amidst the storm of a potential Global Trade War . As the world continues to navigate complex international relations, understanding these dynamics becomes paramount for investors, policymakers, and everyday citizens alike. The resilience of national economies will be tested, demanding agile responses and strategic foresight to weather future economic uncertainties.

2025-08-04 18:50:35,49538384,1754333435,Trump says he will raise tariffs on Indian exports over Modi’s oil trade with Russia,"President Donald Trump on Monday said he will “substantially” punish India in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s continued oil trade with Russia and refusal to cut ties with President Vladimir Putin. The message, posted on Truth Social, accused India of buying “massive amounts” of Russian crude and reselling much of it for a profit on the global market. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,” Trump wrote . “Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.” The post follows a 25% tariff Trump already announced last week on Indian exports, after trade negotiations between Washington and New Delhi broke down. The new tariffs landed without warning and stunned Indian officials, who had spent months trying to secure a deal. Trump’s latest threat arrives days before an August 8 deadline his administration has set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. If no truce is reached, the U.S. has warned of additional penalties, including secondary sanctions on countries still buying Russian energy. India is one of them. India ignores pressure, says oil trade will continue Modi and his cabinet aren’t backing away from the energy deals. Government officials have not instructed Indian refiners, state-run or private, to stop purchasing from Russia. No decision has been made to scale back, even after Trump’s latest warning. The buying decisions are being left to the refiners, who still prefer Russia’s discounted barrels. India started buying large amounts of Russian crude after the Ukraine war broke out in 2022. So far this year, the country has been importing around 1.7 million barrels a day, according to tanker-tracking data from Bloomberg. At the same time, India exported 1.4 million barrels of refined fuel daily in the first six months of the year. Diesel and gasoil made up about 40% of those exports, while gasoline and blendstock accounted for roughly 30%. Over the weekend, Modi addressed the trade war in a public rally in Uttar Pradesh. “The world economy is going through many apprehensions, there is an atmosphere of instability,” he said. The rally came just days after Trump’s 25% tariff announcement. India’s Ministry of External Affairs responded to Trump’s post the same day. “The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,” the ministry said on X. It also pointed to the U.S. and European Union still conducting trade with Russia even when it’s not a matter of “vital national compulsion.” They added that India’s energy purchases were made to keep domestic prices stable and ensure affordability for Indian consumers, calling it a “necessity compelled by global market situation.” Washington raises stakes as Modi defends Russia ties India has refused to shift its position on Russia. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday that the country’s foreign relationships stand on “their own merit” and shouldn’t be “seen from the prism of a third country.” He also defended the decades-old ties with Moscow, describing it as a “steady and time-tested partnership.” Asked if the friction with Washington would derail bilateral ties, Jaiswal said, “I’m confident that the relationship will continue to move forward.” The White House, on the other hand, continues to tighten the screws. Trump told reporters Sunday that special envoy Steve Witkoff would travel to Russia later this week for more discussions. That visit is expected to happen on Wednesday or Thursday. Meanwhile, tensions with Moscow keep building. Last week, Trump said he had moved two U.S. nuclear submarines in response to comments made by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who had issued what Trump called “highly provocative statements.” Back in India, the focus is shifting inward. Modi has pushed a renewed message of self-reliance and domestic consumption, tying it to his long-running “Make in India” campaign. He told the Uttar Pradesh crowd that protecting India’s farmers, small businesses, and youth employment is non-negotiable. His government is also refusing to open the country’s dairy and agricultural markets to U.S. companies, citing both religious and political sensitivities. Putin, for his part, isn’t moving either. The Kremlin has dismissed Trump’s pressure campaign, saying Russia’s military objectives in Ukraine remain the same. That only drives Trump crazier.

The initiative could test demand for low‑priced blockchain‑verified collectibles in mainstream consumer markets. Integration with Alibaba’s broader ecosystem may accelerate adoption across commerce and digital services. Ant Group’s digital asset platform Topnod has launched its “Online Digital Art Exhibition,” according to a Sina Technology News report published on August 4. Unlike the B2C model adopted by other digital art marketplaces, the platform allows creators to upload and sell their artworks once they have passed copyright review and declaration. Each purchase is recorded with a unique blockchain identification number, providing permanent ownership to the buyer. Pre‑Sale and Public Sale Model Topnod said the exhibition adopts a “pre‑sale + public sale” structure. During pre‑sale, user interest helps determine whether the artwork will be issued, the quantity minted, and its pricing. Public sales then proceed with finalized editions. The pricing model, typically ranging between 8 and 28 yuan (about 1–4 USD), is designed as a small “tip‑like” mechanism for users to support their preferred artists. Within three hours of launch, 4,088 pieces were reserved by users, according to the report. Artists, including painter Dai Dunbang and recent graduates of art academies, are among the first group of participants. The platform said it intends to help creators gain visibility while receiving market feedback to support ongoing work. Support for Digital Art Creators A Topnod program manager said the platform will allocate internal and external traffic resources to promote the exhibition and retail creator shops. It will also provide support to help artists attract and manage fans. Topnod also plans to develop a digital artist ecosystem to foster collaboration among creators and integrate online and offline engagement. Ant Group is an affiliate of Alibaba Group , best known for operating Alipay, and has been expanding its presence in blockchain through initiatives focused on digital finance and asset verification. Ant Group was excited to participate in WAIC 2025 in Shanghai, where we showcased our comprehensive advancements in AI technologies and products, including the AI healthcare manager AQ and a series of AI large models.

Topnod shows Ant Group’s ongoing strategy to integrate blockchain into consumer‑facing platforms, extending beyond payments into digital identity, data services, and now cultural content. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What role could blockchain play in intellectual property enforcement through Topnod? Unique blockchain IDs provide verifiable ownership records, potentially reducing counterfeit risks and strengthening copyright protection for digital artists. Could Topnod’s model influence global digital art markets? If successful, the model could encourage other markets to adopt blockchain‑verified collectibles with micro‑pricing to expand participation. What challenges might the platform face? Adoption could depend on demand, user trust, regulatory approval, and whether low‑cost digital art translates into sustainable income for creators.

2025-08-04 18:44:47,49537573,1754333087,"CrediX DeFi Protocol Exploited as Hacker Gains Admin Rights, Drains Pool","DeFi lending protocol CrediX suffered a $4.5 million exploit after attackers gained administrative control of the project’s multisig wallet and abused bridge privileges to mint unbacked collateral tokens. The breach occurred six days before detection when the compromised admin account was granted multiple high-level roles, including pool admin, bridge controller, and emergency admin permissions. Source: SlowMist on X Blockchain security firms SlowMist and PeckShield identified that the attacker used Tornado Cash-funded addresses to bridge funds to the Sonic network before exploiting the BRIDGE role to mint acUSDC tokens directly. The hacker then borrowed large amounts against the worthless collateral, draining approximately $2.64 million from the protocol’s lending pools. Attack Mirrors Previous Exchange Exploits Using Admin Compromise The CrediX exploit follows a pattern established by major crypto hacks, including the $234 million WazirX breach in July 2024 . Both attacks involved compromised administrative access that bypassed normal security measures through legitimate-appearing transactions from authorized accounts. Security analysis revealed that the attacker’s address 0xF321***662e held extensive privileges across CrediX’s infrastructure. The POOL_ADMIN, BRIDGE, ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN, EMERGENCY_ADMIN, and RISK_ADMIN roles provided comprehensive control over protocol operations and asset management. Today's @CrediX_fi hack is due to compromised admin account 0xF321683831Be16eeD74dfA58b02a37483cEC662e, which has a number of roles, including POOL_ADMIN, BRIDGE, ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN, EMERGENCY_ADMIN, and RISK_ADMIN. And the BRIDGE role is abused to drain/borrow pool assets… https://t.co/JGuLmh8zWu pic.twitter.com/0jmAuvtcJv — PeckShield Inc. (@peckshield) August 4, 2025 The bridge role abuse allowed direct minting of collateral tokens without backing assets, creating artificial value that supported massive borrowing positions. After draining the pools, most stolen funds were bridged back to the Ethereum mainnet with no subsequent movement detected by monitoring systems. CrediX immediately disabled its website to prevent additional user deposits while directing existing users to withdraw funds directly through smart contracts. The protocol had previously secured a $60 million credit line in 2023, making it a major player in institutional DeFi lending markets. The attack methodology resembles the WazirX hack, where malicious actors manipulated multisig wallet interfaces to trick authorized signers into approving compromised smart contract upgrades. Both incidents leveraged open vulnerabilities in known administrative access controls and multisig security implementations. Crypto Security Deteriorates Amid Rising Exploit Frequency The CrediX breach adds to crypto’s devastating 2025 security record, with July losses reaching $142 million across 17 major incidents , according to PeckShield data. July crypto hack losses surge 27% to $142 million with CoinDCX's $44 million insider breach and GMX's $42 million exploit leading victims. #July #CryptoHack https://t.co/4UCMKaxUvI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 The 27.2% increase from June’s $111.6 million reversed a temporary decline in hack-related losses. Major July exploits included Indian exchange CoinDCX losing $44.2 million through insider involvement and GMX protocol suffering $42 million in re-entrancy attacks. The CoinDCX incident involved employee Rahul Agarwal, whose compromised laptop provided hackers with system access after receiving malicious files from German contacts. Physical violence against crypto holders escalated alongside digital attacks, with 32 “wrench attacks” reported globally in 2025. For example, France experienced nearly one-third of incidents , including kidnapping attempts targeting crypto executives and their family members, with ransom demands reaching €7 million. Crypto investors also lost over $2.2 billion in 2025’s first half through 344 separate incidents, already exceeding all of 2024’s security losses. Wallet-related breaches accounted for $1.7 billion across 34 attacks, while phishing scams stole $410 million in 132 incidents. The WazirX exchange remains in legal proceedings following its 2024 hack, with Singapore’s High Court recently allowing creditor revoting on an amended restructuring plan . The court reversal provides hope for affected users who have been unable to access funds for nearly one year. Recovery efforts across all 2025 incidents have returned $187 million through law enforcement action, white-hat agreements, and exchange cooperation. However, net losses still total approximately $2.29 billion with an average incident loss of $7.1 million. For CrediX, the protocol has announced a full refund for all affected users within 24-48 hours, with a post-mortem report expected to be released after restoration.

2025-08-04 18:41:40,49537430,1754332900,"Quant Analyst PlanB Predicts Contrarian $300,000 Bitcoin Price Target – Here’s His Timeline","Widely followed quant analyst PlanB is taking an opposing view to most traders about the chances of Bitcoin ( BTC ) reaching $300,000. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous BTC analyst PlanB tells his 216,000 YouTube subscribers that while most market participants don’t expect BTC to reach $300,000 by the end of 2026, he does. “Now, 60% of people think that Bitcoin will not reach $300,000 by the end of 2026 – that’s this line, one and a half years from now. So, by the end of next year, this is the $300,000 point. Sixty percent of people think we’re not going to get there. In my opinion, we will. In fact, I think we’ll go a little higher, to the stock-to-flow target of $500,000 on average. That’s a very rough model, of course, based on scarcity and the stock-to-flow ratio. It has a range of $250,000 to $1 million, so the average could be $300,000 or $600,000. That’s all good, but at the very least, it will be higher than what most people think.” The stock-to-flow model is a predictive tool that assumes the scarcity of a commodity drives the price. While originally created to track traditional commodities, PlanB was the first to apply it to Bitcoin. The analyst is also watching Bitcoin’s realized price indicator, which looks at what price certain cohorts of coins were last transacted on-chain, divided by the number of bitcoins in circulation. Given that the price of BTC is above all the major cohorts, PlanB says there are no signs of a bear market to be seen. “Now, that’s classic bull market behavior, right? You can see that in all bull markets – the 2-year is above the realized, the 6-month is above the 2-year, and then Bitcoin, represented by the red dots, is above them all. So there’s no bear market warning signs whatsoever.” BTC is worth $115,043 at time of writing, up 1% on the day.

2025-08-04 18:40:43,49538456,1754332843,"4 best cryptos to buy today and hold until 2026 to make $1,000,000 from $2,000","With a new bull run approaching, investing $2,000 on breakout coins such as LILPEPE, TON, SEI, and DOGE can grow your investment by 2026. These projects load meme energy while being technologically advanced and swiftly adopted, making them favourable for great gains during the next wave of cryptocurrency. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Current price: $0.002 Potential by 2026: $1+ Little Pepe is a fast-rising meme coin that blends community-driven hype with real utility through its Layer-2 blockchain. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on market sentiment, LILPEPE is building its zero-tax, bot-resistant Layer-2 chain optimized for launching and trading meme coins. Its presale is nearly sold out, signalling strong early interest, and the team plans multiple CEX listings post-launch. What makes Little Pepe especially compelling is its massive upside potential from its extremely low price point. An increase to just $0.01 would mean a 5,000%+ gain! That’s a lot, no doubt, but a climb to $1 would mean a 500,000x return, turning $2,000 into a whopping $1 billion! Such crazy profits are extremely hard to come by, but even a sliver of that target would yield profits in the millions. Why hold until 2026? Little Pepe is in its early phase and has yet to hit major exchanges. As its ecosystem matures and its Layer-2 solution gains adoption, it could mirror the meteoric rise of Shiba Inu and PEPE, with utility to back it up. Toncoin (TON) Current Price: ~$3.30 Potential by 2026: $15–$25 Toncoin, the native token of The Open Network, is making serious strides toward mainstream adoption, especially after integrating a Toncoin wallet directly into Telegram for 87 million US users. This move positions TON as one of the few Layer-1 blockchains with a real-world communication app driving daily usage. The newly established $400 million institutional treasury is even more significant, created without a traditional fundraising round. Supported by Kingsway Capital and top US venture firms, this war chest is earmarked for ecosystem development, liquidity support, and new partnerships, signalling long-term confidence in TON’s success. Technically, Toncoin has reclaimed its key $3.00 level and is poised for a 20–21% short-term breakout to $3.70 or higher. In the long term, the combination of Telegram-based retail adoption and institutional backing makes Toncoin a strong contender for a $15–$25 valuation by 2026. Why hold until 2026? TON has the infrastructure, partnerships, and user base to become a leading innovative contract platform — especially if Telegram becomes the “WeChat of crypto.” With a solid foundation and real-world utility, Toncoin is one of today’s most undervalued large-cap plays. SEI (SEI Network) Current Price: ~$0.35 Potential by 2026: $5–$7 SEI Network is a speedy Layer-1 blockchain for DeFi, trading, and gaming. SEI’s smart consensus model and lightning-fast transaction finality make it different. These features let SEI take on high-frequency trading workloads that older chains struggle to handle. The current technical setup is bullish across multiple timeframes. SEI recently broke out of a long-standing trendline resistance, retested support successfully, and maintains momentum above $0.345. With rising volume and RSI in the low 60s, there’s room for a parabolic move if key resistance levels are flipped. SEI is targeting $0.45 in the short term, but its long-term upside is far greater. With a rapidly maturing ecosystem and increased adoption in DeFi and GameFi sectors, SEI could realistically achieve a $5–$7 valuation within the next cycle. Why hold until 2026? SEI’s technical underpinnings and specific use-case focus make it one of the most scalable and utility-rich chains in development. As DeFi regains momentum, chains like SEI that optimize for speed and efficiency will be in high demand. Dogecoin (DOGE) Current Price: ~$0.25 Potential by 2026: $1.50–$3.00 Dogecoin is the first-ever meme coin and one of the strongest assets still trading in the crypto world. Even though some people still think of it as a simple prank coin, DOGE has grown a considerable fan base, has actual ways people use it daily (like tipping and sending payments), and even sees heavy trading from big institutions. As of late July 2025, Dogecoin is back in a key accumulation zone ($0.15–$0.22) that historically precedes explosive rallies. Analysts like Ali Martinez and TradingShot indicate that DOGE mirrors its 2021 breakout structure. A run to $0.50 by September is feasible, and a $1.50–$3.00 price by 2026 isn’t out of the question if historical trends repeat. Whale accumulation is surging, with over 1.08 billion DOGE scooped up in 48 hours. This, combined with a breakout above a descending trendline and bullish momentum on multiple timeframes, suggests that DOGE’s next parabolic phase may be approaching. Why hold until 2026? DOGE has proven staying power, wide retail recognition, and institutional support. Should another meme-fueled rally take place, particularly with new altcoin adoption cycles, there’s no doubt that Dogecoin could surpass its previous all-time high (ATH). Bottom line: turning $2,000 into $1,000,000 Let’s break down a sample investment strategy to aim for that elusive $1 million target: $500 in Little Pepe @ $0.0018 → Potential 555,000 LILPEPE → If LILPEPE hits $1 = $555,000 $500 in Toncoin @ $3.30 → ~151 TON → If TON hits $25 = $3,775 $500 in SEI @ $0.35 → ~1,428 SEI → If SEI hits $7 = $10,000 $500 in Dogecoin @ $0.25 → 2,000 DOGE → If DOGE hits $3 = $6,000 Even conservative estimates suggest huge upside, but if even one of these coins makes a 100x+ move — especially Little Pepe — it could carry the portfolio to millionaire status.

Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6, with the token priced at $0.035. The next price rise is set at 14.29% higher, which will take the token to $0.04. Presale buyers who invest during this phase will experience a return on investment of 71.43% upon launch of the token at $0.06. MUTM presale has raised more than $14 million and gained more than 14,800 unique holders. While ADA’s price momentum remains under the microscope amid fluctuating macroeconomic signals and shifting investor sentiment, the rising interest in Mutuum Finance is quietly gaining traction. Cardano (ADA) Pushes Toward $1 As Resistance Nears $0.85 Cardano is currently trading around $0.76, having climbed from July lows in the $0.60–$0.65 range and holding firm above key support near $0.80 after a breakout from a multi-week consolidation pattern. Technical signals are showing strength: rising open interest, a bullish pennant breakout, and key EMAs turning higher, fueling analyst expectations of a rally toward $1.00–$1.20, with some forecasts even projecting $2.00–$3.00 later in 2025 if momentum continues and ecosystem adoption accelerates. Still, failure to clear resistance around $0.85–$0.90 could see ADA remain range-bound or retrace toward $0.70–$0.75 in the near term. In this market, traders are also monitoring evolving DeFi themes and emerging utility protocols like Mutuum Finance. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance just ended its Phase 5 presale and moved into Phase 6, with its tokens selling at $0.035. The next price adjustment will see another 14.29% increase to take the token price to $0.04. Early investors will enjoy a 71.43% ROI when the token falls at $0.06. The presale of MUTM already raised more than $14 million and acquired more than 14,800 individual holders. Mutuum Finance Partners with CertiK to Launch $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a Bug Bounty Program. The program reward pool is $50,000 USDT. Four severities i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded. The move showcases the objective of Mutuum Finance to create community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been extensively audited by Certik for user fund security and blockchain security. The triumph is a success of Mutuum Finance’s vision of being an open and institutional-grade DeFi protocol. Massive MUTM Token Giveaway Unveiled by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein the users will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Its recently launched leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders. Cardano (ADA) may aim for $3, but it’s still trading under $0.80 with heavy resistance ahead. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining fast at just $0.035. It’s now in Presale Phase 6 with a 14.29% price jump coming soon. At launch, the token will list at $0.06, giving investors a 71.43% ROI. Over $14 million has already been raised. More than 14,800 investors are in.

2025-08-04 18:26:45,49536775,1754332005,UK Bans Coinbase’s ‘Everything Is Fine’ Ad: CEO Says It Exposes Flaws in Finance,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has responded to the backlash surrounding the company’s latest advertisement for the UK market. He clarified that the video was not intended as a political statement, but rather as a reflection of the deeper issues within the traditional financial system. The Controversial Campaign The U.S.-based exchange recently posted an advertisement on July 31 via X, criticizing the UK’s financial system. Titled ‘Everything Is Fine’, the video features a cheerful song and lyrics that brag about the UK’s strong finances, while showing harsh scenes of inflation, poverty, debt, and people struggling to get by. Meant as a satirical depiction of the state of things, it starts with the line, “We ain’t got no troubles. No reason to complain,” while broken homes and poor people appear on the screen. The song continues, “The streets can’t get no cleaner. Nor the rat meat any leaner. No. Life is just as great,” as dirty streets flash across the screen. The video also makes fun of how expensive things have become in the UK. However, on August 4, Armstrong took to X, claiming the ad had been “banned in the UK by the TV networks,” suggesting it had been censored because it carried an element of truth. “If you can’t say it, then there must be a kernel of truth in it.” Some individuals and politicians have criticized the campaign, arguing that it is a political statement intended to discredit the current government and make Britain a laughingstock. However, the executive explained that calling for updates to the system and societal improvements wasn’t meant to be a political statement about any party in the UK. He also clarified that the clip wasn’t specific to the country, mentioning that the firm had also run ads with similar themes in the U.S.. Crypto As a Fix For Broken Systems According to Armstrong, the point of the clip was to highlight how the traditional financial system is failing many people and how crypto offers a way to address the issue. He added that some people in the UK still view the asset class as “some kind of gambling product,” which he described as a very outdated perspective that ignores its real potential to improve conditions for everyone. The executive concluded by welcoming criticism and censorship efforts, saying they only help the message spread further. The controversial campaign comes at a time when 20.3 million people in the UK, which is 44% of all adults, are living in financially unstable conditions. According to a recent report by Fair4All Finance, this represents a 16% increase since 2022, driven by factors such as unstable incomes, limited savings, poor health, and job loss. Meanwhile, experts say the UK is falling behind in creating clear rules for crypto. A July report from independent think tank OMFIF says that the country continues to make vague promises about future rules in what it described as “policy procrastination,” warning that the EU and U.S. are now leading the way.

2025-08-04 18:26:08,49536819,1754331968,"Donald Trump to Make Two Critical Appointments in the Next Few Days – Could Affect Markets, Here Are the Details","US President Donald Trump is planning to make new appointments to two key institutions in the coming days. This includes filling the vacant position at the Federal Reserve and appointing new directors to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The openings in question occurred on Friday. The first Fed post was opened by the surprise resignation of Board Member Adriana Kugler, while the second position was left vacant after Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he was considering several candidates for the Fed and would soon appoint a replacement for McEntarfer. “I have a few names in mind, and I'll probably announce them in the next few days,” he said. Kugler's term was set to end in January, but he decided to leave early, effective August 8. He did not provide a reason in his letter to Trump. Kugler, who served on the Fed's board, was also a permanent member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates in the U.S. economy. Board members also have a say in banking regulations. Kugler, whose term lasted less than two years, largely aligned with Chairman Jerome Powell's policies. Powell, however, has been a frequent critic of Trump. Trump has previously stated that future Fed nominees will be considered for their propensity to vote for interest rate cuts. Related News: Analysis Company CEO Predicts Potential Altcoin Season - “Transition from Bitcoin to Altcoins...” Krishna Guha, a global policy strategist at Evercore ISI, said Kugler's resignation “accelerates Trump's drive to bring the Fed into line.” Guha believes Trump could use the vacancy to appoint a potential replacement for Powell. Possible candidates include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. McEntarfer's dismissal, meanwhile, comes on the heels of Friday's weak nonfarm payrolls data. According to the BLS, only 73,000 new jobs were added to the US economy in July, while the figures for the previous two months were revised downward by a combined 258,000. Trump criticized McEntarfer in a post on Truth Social on Sunday, holding him responsible for “the biggest calculation errors of the last 50 years.” While revisions to monthly employment data are commonplace, such corrections have become more frequent in recent years as the BLS has experienced a decline in survey responses. Indeed, the agency downgraded its total employment data by 818,000 jobs for the 12 months through March 2024. Speaking to CNBC, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said, “Transparency and reliability in labor force data are crucial. The market positions itself based on this data. Therefore, a fresh perspective is needed.” However, McEntarfer's dismissal sparked backlash due to concerns that an institution like the BLS, which is expected to be technical and impartial, could become politicized. “The politicization of the Fed has been much discussed in recent months, but the politicization of the data collection process is just as dangerous,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Economist Michael Feroli commented. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-04 18:25:40,49538973,1754331940,DCG’s Barry Silbert Returns to Grayscale as Chairman Amid IPO Push,"Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) Barry Silbert has been re-appointed as chairman of the board at asset manager Grayscale, one of DCG's subsidiaries, alongside several other new, high-ranking hires at the firm. Silbert, who owns Grayscale, resigned in December 2023 after the company was hit with a lawsuit from the New York Attorney General’s office which accused Silbert and DCG of misleading investors and hiding financial losses totaling more than $1 billion. Both Silbert and DCG denied the claims, and the case is ongoing in New York state court. Silbert was replaced by DCG's chief financial officer Mark Shifke, who will remain a board member. Grayscale filed a confidential submission for an initial public offering last month, despite the ongoing legal back-and-forth with the New York Attorney General's office. ""I'm honored to rejoin the Grayscale board at a defining moment for both the company and the broader digital asset ecosystem,"" Silbert said in a statement. ""I continue to have deep conviction in the company’s long-term positioning and in the leadership team guiding it forward.""

The transaction includes a €5 million capital increase at €2.90 per share and €6.5 million in convertible bonds through its Luxembourg subsidiary, The Blockchain Group Luxembourg SA. TOBAM Partnership Fuels 2,275% Strategy Returns Capital B announces a capital increase and a convertible bonds issuance for an amount of ~€11.5 million with TOBAM BITCOIN ALPHA FUND to pursue its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/w9CKirG4j8 Full Press Release (FR):… pic.twitter.com/kdIlME04xd — Capital B (@_ALCPB) August 4, 2025 The funding could allow Capital B to acquire approximately 160 additional Bitcoin, bringing the potential total holdings to 2,173 BTC as Europe’s first listed Bitcoin treasury company. The convertible bonds carry a five-year maturity with conversion prices ranging from €3.66 to €4.75 per share, with 95% of proceeds designated for Bitcoin acquisition. Capital B’s ALTBG strategy component delivered exceptional returns of 2,275% from November 2024 to July 2025, vastly outperforming Bitcoin’s 58% gain during the same period. The company’s sats per share metric increased from 15 in November 2024 to 1,933 by July 2025, following multiple capital raises and strategic partnerships. The deal coincides with accelerating corporate Bitcoin adoption globally, as MicroStrategy acquired 21,021 BTC for $2.46 billion at $117,256 per coin, bringing total holdings to 628,791 BTC. Strategy has acquired 21,021 BTC for ~$2.46 billion at ~$117,256 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.0% YTD 2025.

The first tranche of €6.5 million converts at €3.6557 per share, representing 130% of the July 31 volume-weighted average price. A second optional tranche worth €13 million can be exercised within three months at higher conversion prices designed to ensure a positive BTC yield. The conversion rate equals either a 30% premium to the first tranche price or a floor price to maintain Bitcoin accumulation per diluted share. TOBAM gained considerable influence through the transaction, with potential ownership reaching 4.47% on a fully diluted basis. The partnership builds on previous collaborations, including OCA B-02 and OCA A-03 agreements that contributed to Capital B’s growth trajectory. The Luxembourg subsidiary structure allows European regulatory compliance while maintaining focus on Bitcoin treasury operations. Zero-coupon bonds provide cost-effective financing compared to traditional debt instruments while preserving equity upside through conversion features. Source: Capital B Capital B’s strategy targets Bitcoin-per-share growth over dividends or traditional returns. The company tracks sats per share as a key performance indicator, measuring Bitcoin accumulation relative to share dilution from capital raises. Corporate Bitcoin Wave Accelerates Amid Market Volatility MicroStrategy launched a $4.2 billion at-the-market equity program for STRC preferred shares following record quarterly performance. Net income surged to $2.3 billion, driven by unrealized Bitcoin gains as BTC soared above $110,000 during Q2 2025. The company also raised $10.5 billion in gross proceeds over four months through multiple share classes and ATM facilities. Additionally, Bitcoin holdings valued at approximately $69.4 billion generate substantial balance-sheet appreciation during crypto market rallies. Similarly, Metaplanet filed for $3.6 billion in preferred stock funding while adding 463 Bitcoin to reach 17,595 total coins worth $1.78 billion. The Japanese firm achieved 430.2% year-to-date BTC yield through aggressive accumulation funded by equity issuances and bond redemptions. European adoption expanded with Smarter Web Company surpassing 2,000 Bitcoin holdings after purchasing 225 BTC for £19.9 million . The London-listed firm achieved 49,198% year-to-date BTC yield under its “10 Year Plan” treasury strategy. However, skepticism emerged as Bitcoin ETFs recorded $643 million in net outflows last week, ending a seven-week inflow streak.

In addition, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel criticized at-the-market programs that become dilutive when stock prices approach Bitcoin’s net asset value.

2025-08-04 18:09:19,49536169,1754330959,CrediX Loses $4.5M in Hack Due to Compromised Admin Account,"CrediX, a decentralized exchange that lets people trade synthetic digital dollars, USDC, without a middleman, has just suffered a serious hack. Attackers were able to steal around $4.5 million after gaining access to a compromised administrator account. As revealed , the account had access to some of the most powerful controls within the system. The event has triggered panic among investors and users. The protocol’s development team has yet to provide clear answers or a recovery plan. Hacker Fakes Tokens and Drains Millions from CrediX The exploit started when an attacker took over an admin account on CrediX. This account had very wide permissions across the platform. It could control pools, move assets, handle emergencies, and change risk settings. With this level of access, the attacker could carry out operations that usually need several approvals. The hacker was able to create a large amount of fake USDC tokens. For context, acUSDC is a made-up version of USDC that only works inside CrediX and it is not backed by real assets. The attacker then used the fake tokens to borrow real funds from the platform’s pools. After that, they moved the real assets out and stole funds that users had entrusted to the platform. This event has added to the growing list of 2025 DeFi security breaches. Website Goes Down, Investors Left Confused After the attack, CrediX quickly took down its website. The team advised users to bypass the standard site and use smart contracts directly to access their funds. This shows how serious the hack really was. The platform did not have backup systems in place to remove or limit the stolen permissions, so the developers were forced to take the entire interface offline. This situation has caused fear and confusion among users, many of whom are unsure about the safety of their assets. So far, the developers have not released any full explanation, audit report, or timeline for fixing the problem. As a result, investors are left with little information and growing doubts. Collapse of Trust in the Protocol The damage caused by this breach goes beyond the stolen funds. Trust in the entire CrediX protocol has been deeply affected. The acUSDC token, which played an important role in the platform, has lost its credibility since it was used to drain the pools without proper backing. Other tokens linked to CrediX, including those used for governance or utility, are also likely to lose value. Developers and users now question the safety of CrediX’s smart contracts. Experts said that the fact that one account was able to act with such power across different areas of the system shows a major design flaw. In decentralized finance , there is always risk, but this kind of setup creates a single point of failure that can bring down the entire platform if compromised.

Early Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin holders know precisely what it feels like to watch a joke coin explode into a billion-dollar asset. And now, these same early birds are swarming into something new. A meme token. Dirt cheap. Community-rich. Infrastructure-loaded. It’s called Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , and it’s not just catching attention. It’s a stealing conviction. Investors who once rode SHIB and PEPE to generational wealth believe this under-$0.003 meme coin is on track to the top 10 crypto rank. From laughs to Lambos: what SHIB and PEPE veterans are seeing in $LILPEPE Ask any Shiba or Pepe early adopter what made them invest. They’ll tell you it wasn’t just the memes. It was the feeling. That rare, electric buzz around a project is still flying under the radar, but it is building all the right pieces. Little Pepe is delivering that same spark. But with one major upgrade: incorporating real tech into the momentum. Little Pepe is delivering real value under the hood. It introduces its personal Layer-2 ecosystem, a fast, scalable foundation that powers the entire project. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on sentiment, Little Pepe offers actual DeFi potential. This sets LILPEPE up for a legacy-building movement. This ain’t just another meme coin. it’s a meme engine! Think of what made Pepe explode: meme energy, lightning-fast virality, and non-stop community fuel. Imagine giving that same firepower a Launchpad, an ecosystem layer where other tokens can be born, presales can happen, and DEX launches can thrive. That’s what Little Pepe is doing with the Pepe Launchpad. This tax-free, sniper bot-resistant platform gives early-stage projects and investors a real fighting chance. It’s like launching Dogecoin… but with a real use case and DeFi backbone. With a recent smart contract audit completed, a live listing on CoinMarketCap, and a highly anticipated CEX debut scheduled for after the presale, LILPEPE is building trust around its technology and momentum. A presale story that feels like 2021 again When SHIB was trading in fractions of a cent, few people believed it could do what it did. The same was true of PEPE. But in hindsight, it’s always obvious: community + early entry + strong narrative = moon. Little Pepe has all three. The presale has entered Stage 9, with over 9.75 billion tokens sold. The token is up 80% from Stage 1, rising from $0.001 to $0.0018. The final launch price is $0.003, which means buyers today are still early. And if that wasn’t enough? The team runs a $777,000 giveaway, with ten winners receiving $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. That kind of bold, attention-grabbing move can quickly build a viral army. Will it 100x? or just crack the top 10? Let’s be real: the market doesn’t owe anyone another 100x. But when thousands of meme veterans who made life-changing gains from SHIB and PEPE start calling something the next big thing, it’s wise to pay attention. Little Pepe is not some recycled meme with a new face. It’s a complete ecosystem, still a micro-cap. However, that micro-cap status may not last long with post-launch exchange support, growing daily volume, and a roadmap that includes major ecosystem upgrades. Top 10? It’s too early to say. But 100x from here? Very possible. Very believable. And judging by the wallets loading daily, a growing army of meme coin legends already agrees. If you missed SHIB or PEPE, this is your do-over Most people didn’t buy SHIB at launch. Most ignored PEPE until it was too late. But LILPEPE is still ridiculously early. The holders who made millions on previous meme cycles aren’t just watching anymore. They’re buying. Since $LILPEPE is already becoming the next meme movement, those who know what to look for are already invested. The next SHIB? The next PEPE? No, this is the first Little Pepe. Jump into the presale.

2025-08-04 18:05:58,49535997,1754330758,Pundit: XRP is the Liquidity in a Tokenized World,"In a thought-provoking post on X, financial commentator John Squire declared , “In a tokenized world, $XRP is the liquidity layer.” His statement reflects a broader shift in how XRP is perceived, not merely as a speculative digital asset, but as a foundational element in the emerging architecture of tokenized finance. XRP as the Liquidity Engine of Tokenized Markets Tokenization , the process of converting real-world assets (RWAs) like bonds, currencies, and equities into blockchain-based tokens, is rapidly transforming global finance. As this trend accelerates, the need for a universal liquidity bridge becomes paramount. According to Squire, XRP is uniquely positioned to serve that role. Through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, XRP already enables cross-border payments without the need for pre-funded accounts. This functionality has made XRP instrumental in remittance corridors and low-friction settlement across fiat currencies. But the scope is now expanding. Ripple’s partnerships with institutions, including the $280 million digital commercial paper tokenized on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), mark XRP’s growing role in institutional capital markets. Challenging Market Cap Misconceptions Squire has consistently challenged what he calls “Excel logic”—the belief that XRP cannot reach higher valuations due to its market cap. He points to historical market behavior where small inflows led to significant price increases, highlighting how limited circulating supply and deep-pocketed holders create conditions for steep, liquidity-driven moves. With over 95% of XRP held long-term or locked in escrow, a relatively small increase in demand can create disproportionate upward pressure on price. This idea is not merely theoretical. Market cycles have shown how XRP can surge during periods of heightened demand, and Squire argues this dynamic will intensify as tokenized asset adoption grows. Real-World Tokenization Use Cases Squire emphasizes XRP’s real-world utility as tokenization gains traction . Forecasts suggest over $19 trillion in assets will be tokenized by 2033, and Ripple is already building infrastructure to support that future. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projects such as real estate tokenization, tokenized treasuries, and debt instruments on XRPL reflect this evolution. Corporate adoption is growing, too—Webus recently announced a $100 million initiative to incorporate XRP into its treasury reserves. This expanding utility aligns with Ripple’s vision of the XRP Ledger as a platform for compliant, interoperable tokenized finance, bridging different asset classes and currencies seamlessly. Institutional Barriers and Compliance Workarounds Despite XRP’s capabilities, regulatory hurdles remain. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz , recently noted that Ripple cannot use the XRPL’s native decentralized exchange (DEX) due to compliance concerns. However, he supports the development of “permissioned domains”—private, regulatory-compliant zones within XRPL that would allow institutions to tap into its liquidity without breaching legal boundaries. Squire spotlighted this as a key solution to bridge institutional demand with decentralized infrastructure. John Squire’s assertion—that “XRP is the liquidity layer” in a tokenized world—is supported by a growing body of real-world evidence. XRP is no longer just a payment token; it is becoming the underlying engine that facilitates liquidity across tokenized economies. From enabling seamless global payments to powering institutional-grade tokenization, XRP is emerging as the bridge asset for tomorrow’s financial system . As tokenization continues to redefine how value moves, Squire’s insight may prove prescient: XRP could very well be the liquidity backbone of the next financial era.

In a post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.8 million followers that Bitcoin may dip below $90,000 this month based on Bitcoin’s historical trend of performing poorly in August – something he refers to as the “August Curse.” However, Kiyosaki says he will make a massive Bitcoin purchase if its current value declines by more than 21%. “Bitcoin curse: will the Bitcoin ‘August curse’ crash Bitcoin’s price to below $90,000? I hope so. I enjoyed an exciting educational summer attending ‘The Collective’ and ‘Limitless Financial’ education event, learning about what lies ahead with speakers such as Larry Lepard, Jim Rickards and other stock, bond, real estate, gold, silver and Bitcoin geniuses – Rickards, Brent Johnson and many other real teachers who practice what they teach, unlike fake school teachers who have no idea what they teach. If the Bitcoin ‘August curse’ hits and Bitcoin crashed, I stand by to 2x my position today. The problem is not Bitcoin. The real problem is our multi-trillion dollar debt and incompetent PhDs running ‘the swamp,’ the Fed and our Treasury. The Bitcoin ‘August curse’ will make most Bitcoin investors richer.” Bitcoin is trading for $114,973 at time of writing, up marginally on the day.

2025-08-04 18:02:00,49536314,1754330520,"Turn $500 Into $40,000 in 100 Days: These 4 Top Meme Coins Have That Energy.","With communities fueled by humor, hype, and real utility, the meme coin scene is full of opportunities. If you want to turn $500 into $40,000 in the next 100 days, these four meme coins might have the explosive potential to do it. Let’s dive into the coins with the biggest breakout energy right now: Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The First Meme Chain Built for Velocity Current Presale Price: $0.0017 Potential Return to $1: 58,000% Leading the list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —a new meme coin with the most utility-packed launch of 2025. LILPEPE isn’t just a coin; it’s the first Layer-2 blockchain specifically built for meme coins. Little Pepe brings a full-blown ecosystem with zero-tax transactions, sniper bot protection, lightning-fast speeds, and a dedicated meme coin launchpad in an industry where most meme tokens rely on hype. With a hard cap of 100 billion tokens and over 96% of the presale already sold, LILPEPE has already generated buzz among early investors. Backed by a seasoned dev team (with ties to multiple successful meme projects) and two top-tier centralized exchange listings confirmed, LILPEPE is gearing up for an explosive debut. Suppose LILPEPE launches even remotely like PEPE or SHIB, a move from $0.0017 to $1 would turn a $500 presale buy into $294,117. Even a far more conservative target of $0.10 would make your $500 worth over $29,000. This coin isn’t just vibing with the meme trend—it’s leading the next wave of it. BONK: Solana’s Comeback King Ready to Retest ATH Current Price: ~$0.000028 Short-Term Target: $0.000045 (ATH) BONK, the poster child of Solana’s meme coin scene, is back in the spotlight. After a healthy consolidation under Take Profit 2 (TP2) levels, BONK is setting up for another bullish leg up. BONK’s volume is rising, and a breakout above $0.000035 could trigger a run to $0.000045+. The RSI currently sits around 60—far from overbought—leaving ample room for upside. BONK also benefits from wider bullish sentiment in the Solana ecosystem, where upgraded performance and lower fees have reignited investor interest. According to top analyst Pentoshi, BONK is a “high-reward play with cross-ecosystem impact”, and with 10% more wallets added in the last month, the signs point to real, organic growth. From a $500 position, a move from $0.000028 to $0.000045 would already net 60% gains, but if BONK continues to ride the Solana wave, a price of $0.0001 isn’t out of reach, turning your $500 into $1,785 or more. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Meme Coin May Still Have One More Moonshot Current Price: $0.25 2025 Price Prediction: $2.30–$3.00 DOGE isn’t new to the party, but it still knows how to shake up the market. Currently trading at $0.25, Dogecoin has re-entered its historic accumulation zone between $0.15–$0.22, which has previously sparked gains of 900% to 13,000%, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Momentum is building again, with whales accumulating over 1.08 billion DOGE in just two days, worth over $250 million. Volume has spiked past $6.2 billion, and the charts show a breakout above a long-term descending trendline, forming bullish patterns like a rounding bottom and megaphone. Analysts believe DOGE could reclaim the $0.73 resistance (its previous ATH) and possibly surge to $2.30–$3.00 if the market favors risk-on assets. A jump from $0.25 to $3.00 represents a 1,100% return. A $500 investment here could turn into $6,000+, assuming DOGE captures even a fraction of its previous hype-driven surge. Dogwifhat (WIF): Cup-and-Handle Primed for a Breakout Current Price: $1.13 Targets: $1.368 (TP1), $1.82 (TP2) Dogwifhat (WIF) has emerged as another fan-favorite with serious technical bullishness. A textbook cup-and-handle pattern has formed on the 3-day chart, with the handle consolidating cleanly through June and July. Now, it’s approaching a breakout point at $1.368. WIF is trading just below that resistance when writing, having already reclaimed critical support at $1.11. Volume has remained consistently high—$432.7 million traded in the past 24 hours—with strong accumulation signals confirmed by Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at +0.08. The full cup-and-handle extension points to a move toward $1.828, a 60% gain from current levels. WIF could climb even further into price discovery mode if bullish momentum holds. A $500 stake at today’s prices could easily be worth $800–$1,000+ within weeks. And if WIF breaks past $2.00 and heads toward the $3.00+ territory, the upside could multiply. Final Thoughts: Meme Coin Mania Isn’t Over—It’s Just Smarter Meme coins are no longer just hype-driven gambles. The top projects in 2025—Little Pepe, BONK, DOGE, and Dogwifhat—combine technical setups, community engagement, institutional interest, and actual blockchain utility. Whether you’re riding with the OG (DOGE), speculating on a Solana favorite (BONK), chasing technicals (WIF), or betting on the next meme ecosystem (LILPEPE), the key is positioning early and managing risk. In this environment, a $500 bet on the right meme coin could realistically turn into $40,000 or more—if not in 100 days, then certainly over the next leg of the bull cycle.

2025-08-04 18:00:41,49536166,1754330441,"Why DOT and UNI Traders Are Exploring Spartans in 2025: Fast Payouts, Big Bonuses, and 5,963 Ways to Play","Polkadot (DOT) and Uniswap (UNI) are drawing attention again as they test important price levels. DOT has moved above $4.60, with possible targets at $8 and $12. UNI broke past $10.80 and is now pushing toward $15, driven by strong growth from Uniswap v4 and over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Both show potential, but the market remains uncertain. Spartans offers a different use case, delivering real-time benefits. With over 5,900 games, quick crypto withdrawals, and sportsbook access in one place, it’s not about waiting. It’s about using crypto in a way that brings instant value. While DOT and UNI face technical hurdles, Spartans gains user confidence by offering direct utility. For those wanting more than just watching price moves, the question becomes whether to wait for another breakout or engage with a crypto sportsbook already offering results. Polkadot (DOT) Price Strength Points to Long-Term Possibility Polkadot (DOT) has jumped more than 32% in the past 10 days, moving past $4.60 and breaking out of a long-standing trendline. Analysts now look for a move toward $8 or even $12, depending on trading volume and continued buying support. With an RSI of 55.92 and the MACD above its signal line, indicators point to ongoing buying interest. DOT’s momentum is also tied to recent updates on the network. Features like Elastic Scaling and the upcoming JAM protocol are bringing more attention to Polkadot. Gavin Wood’s focus on tools like Proof-of-Personhood has drawn new developer interest, helping to build on-chain strength. Still, traders remain cautious. The long/short ratio sits at 1.06, showing moderate optimism. While the outlook for DOT looks better, many are watching closely to see if it can stay above $5.00 before expecting bigger moves. Uniswap (UNI) Builds Support Around New Features and Growing TVL Uniswap v4 has passed $1.026 billion in TVL within 177 days of launch, showing faster growth than the previous version. Daily trading volumes are steady at about $640 million. Layer 2 networks now account for over 67% of this activity, showing wide usage across DeFi. UNI trades near $10.82, with recent volume up 25%. Analysts are watching for a move toward $15, supported by new tools like Hooks in v4. These tools help liquidity providers automate trades, manage risk, and increase returns. Projects like Bunni and EulerSwap have each passed $1 billion in volume, showing strong support for Uniswap’s latest version. Interest in the UNI price target continues, but there are challenges. Market fatigue and strong competition could slow growth. Unlike Spartans, where features are already live and used, UNI’s next steps rely on broader DeFi adoption. A Look at Why Spartans Is Gaining Attention Among Crypto Sportsbook Users While Polkadot (DOT) and Uniswap (UNI) attract attention with their price movements, Spartans is seeing more users through practical use, offering real features without delay. Spartans.com is a crypto-only site that combines sports betting and online casino games into one easy-to-use platform. It hosts over 5,963 games from more than 43 providers, covering slots, blackjack, crash games, roulette, and live game shows. But it’s not just about offering choices; it’s also about speed. Deposits and withdrawals with BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, and other coins are processed right away, avoiding delays tied to traditional banking. Spartans is also gaining a spot among the safe crypto sportsbooks by providing clear and easy-to-understand bonus offers. These include a 300% casino welcome bonus and a 300% sports bonus, each limited to $200, with rules clearly listed. A 25% daily deposit reward adds more for both casual players and regular users looking for steady activity. Another reason users are taking notice is the sportsbook section, which includes matches from the EPL, NBA, UFC, and other leagues. It supports live betting, live match stats, and fast betslip features. The platform works smoothly on mobile without needing any extra apps. Wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet can be used without issue, making the whole experience more direct and simple. Spartans is also running a giveaway that includes a chance to win a Lamborghini. This offer is open to all users who take part on the site. For users who are not interested in waiting for crypto prices to go up, Spartans offers a different way to use their digital assets actively. Key Takeaways DOT and UNI both have possible upside, but they still depend on market trends and long-term plans. Spartans is working right now by offering over 5,900 games, quick crypto payments, and regular sportsbook rewards that are easy to claim. As some users wait to see if DOT holds above $4.60 or if UNI gets closer to $15, others are already using platforms that deliver value today. Spartans is seen by many as one of the more safe crypto sportsbooks because it focuses on ease of use, useful bonuses, and no waiting time for withdrawals. The real decision for many is no longer between DOT or UNI, but whether to wait or take part now. And for those who choose action, Spartans is becoming the choice that fits better today.

Over the past 20 days, Ethereum ETFs have recorded $5.4 billion in net inflows, with only one day of outflows in July. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF alone accumulated more than $4 billion, while the iShares Ethereum Trust added $1.7 billion across 10 straight trading days. This ETF demand marks a strong signal of growing confidence among professional investors. On-chain data also reveals a 40% surge in Ethereum ETF holdings over the last month, a vertical trajectory that underscores rapid institutional adoption. Whale Accumulation Adds Fuel to Ethereum’s Rally Potential Whales are also aggressively accumulating. More than 200 new whale addresses have been added since early July. Notably, one address reportedly purchased $300 million worth of Ether via OTC deals through Galaxy Digital. Despite recent price dips below $3,400, ETH rebounded to $3,560, signaling strong support and buyer interest. Analysts now see the ETH price forming a base for a sustained rally, especially if price closes above key resistance with rising volume.

2025-08-04 18:00:17,49535825,1754330417,"Stake, Roobet, BC.Game Reviewed – Spartans Is Still the Fastest-Payout Crypto Gambling Site of 2025","As crypto betting continues to grow in 2025, one factor stands above all else for serious players: payout speed. Waiting hours, or worse, days, for a withdrawal can ruin the experience, no matter how great the platform’s games or bonuses are. That’s why fast-payout crypto gambling sites are in high demand. Players now expect withdrawals to be processed quickly, directly to their crypto wallets, without delays or manual checks. This list ranks the six top-performing sites when it comes to payout speed, with Spartans taking the lead thanks to its commitment to instant crypto withdrawals and seamless cashout flows. Spartans: Instant Withdrawals Every Time Spartans stands at the top of the fastest-payout crypto gambling sites in 2025. What sets it apart is its ability to send funds instantly, without the lag most platforms suffer from. Whether players win $10 or $10,000, their crypto hits their wallet almost immediately after withdrawal is requested. There’s no waiting for approvals, no ticket submissions, and no pending status. Spartans handles all transactions through its crypto-native infrastructure, supporting top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and more. Unlike other platforms that rely on slow internal processes, Spartans is built to prioritize speed and trust. The same system used for instant player cashouts is also used for affiliate payments, reinforcing the platform’s reputation for transparency. This reliability turns first-time users into regulars and makes it a favorite among those who value quick access to their winnings. Combined with 5,963+ games, sports betting, and smooth mobile optimization, Spartans proves that fast payouts aren’t just a feature, they’re the standard. Stake.com: Same-Day Processing, Usually Within Hours Stake.com is a well-known name in the crypto gambling space, offering solid reliability and a broad game selection. While not instant, its withdrawals are typically processed within a few hours. High-volume players may occasionally face short delays depending on payout size, but overall, Stake provides a dependable same-day experience for most users. Its speed is solid, though not quite instant. Roobet: Decent Speed, Variable for Larger Wins Roobet ranks high for crypto support and entertainment value, and its payout times are generally acceptable. Most players report withdrawal times between one to four hours depending on network congestion and volume. However, some higher-tier withdrawals may take longer due to additional verification. While not the fastest, Roobet maintains a decent balance between security and speed. BC.Game: Delayed for Manual Review in Some Cases BC.Game processes many crypto withdrawals within a day, but several users have noted occasional manual reviews, especially on large payouts. These reviews can extend processing time significantly, which might frustrate players expecting immediate access. The platform is popular for its bonuses and community features, but speed varies based on amount and user verification level. Betano: Slowest Among Crypto-Enabled Platforms While Betano is trusted for traditional sports betting, its crypto functionality is slower and less optimized than others. Withdrawals often require several hours at best and can take over 24 hours depending on account activity. Crypto is still a secondary option here, making Betano better suited to casual users who aren’t in a rush to cash out. Gamdom: Mixed Reviews on Speed Gamdom supports crypto and has a decent reputation, but payout speeds are inconsistent. Some users report same-day withdrawals, while others wait up to 48 hours depending on token used and identity verification status. It’s a solid platform for variety and game types, but not the best choice if fast payouts are your top priority. Last Say Speed is no longer optional in the world of crypto gambling, it’s expected. While several platforms do a decent job processing withdrawals within the same day, only one consistently delivers instant results: Spartans. From immediate wallet credits to frictionless crypto flows, Spartans leads 2025 as the fastest-payout crypto gambling site. If you’re tired of pending statuses and want your winnings in your wallet right away, Spartans offers a solution that’s both fast and reliable. As more players demand real-time experiences, platforms that delay payouts will continue to fall behind, while instant-withdrawal sites like Spartans become the new standard.

2025-08-04 17:44:43,49535526,1754329483,Google agrees to cut AI data center power use during peak demand,"Reports indicate that Google has become the first U.S. Big Tech company to employ demand-response programs as a resolution to the energy concerns resulting from high AI demand. The rapid growth of AI infrastructure is happening faster than the power grid can adapt, leading to concerns about energy shortages and higher electric bills. As a result, Google has entered into an agreement with two U.S. utilities, Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority, to cut power to its data centers during periods of peak demand. Google agrees to cut AI data center power use during peak demand Google entered into agreements with two U.S. electric utilities, Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority, to curb power usage from its artificial intelligence (AI) data centers during periods of peak electricity demand. The agreement was announced on Monday. The demand for AI-driven services like large language models, real-time data analysis, and machine learning, and the power required to support these functions have increased substantially. Tech companies have ramped up requests for new electricity connections to power AI data centers, especially in regions where available supply is already lagging. Some areas have seen a higher demand for electricity from tech firms than the available electricity capacity. The resulting shortage of energy has raised alarms among grid operators and local communities. Power grids are nearing their limits and concerns have emerged over the potential for higher electricity bills for homes and businesses, increased risk of blackouts, and delays in approving new data center projects. How Google’s new demand-response agreement works Demand-response programs involve temporarily reducing electricity consumption during periods of high demand in exchange for financial compensation or reduced utility rates. They help ease pressure on the power grid, lower emissions, and delay the need to build new transmission infrastructure or power plants. Google’s participation is particularly notable because it involves its machine learning workloads that typically run continuously in massive data centers. Under the agreements, Google will reduce or defer some of these workloads during periods when the utilities request it, allowing more electricity to flow to critical systems and households. According to Google, the flexibility offered by these demand-response efforts “allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids.” The specific commercial details of Google’s agreements have not been made public, but the company may set a precedent for other major tech firms like Microsoft , Amazon, and Meta, all of which are also expanding their AI data center footprints.

The token now flirts with $0.41, backed by a $12B market cap and real-world adoption momentum. With big-name integrations and bullish technicals, the blockchain is quietly becoming a highway for global payments, and traders are starting to notice. $XLM Continues to Power Global Finance with Strategic Partnerships The Stellar network operates as a decentralized, fast, and scalable blockchain, purpose-built for financial products, remittances, and real-world asset transactions. Unlike networks that rely on energy-intensive or wealth-concentrated validation models, Stellar is built on a unique Proof-of-Agreement (PoA) consensus known as the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) . SCP secures the network through a system of trusted validators, chosen by each node. Source: DefiLlama While the Total Value Locked (TVL) of $134 billion reflects broader network activity and tokenization beyond just XLM’s DeFi presence, it also shows the substantial economic activity flowing through the Stellar ecosystem. The network is consistently ranked among the top blockchains for cross-border payments, with multi-currency transaction support built in from the outset. Developers and businesses are empowered to build compliant and cost-effective payment solutions that work globally, regardless of local banking infrastructure. The Stellar network isn't just another blockchain. It's purpose-built for the global majority offering: Instant cross-border payments Microsecond settlements Sub-1% transaction fees Real-world impact This week, we'll focus on Africa, where 1.4B people, led by the… — Stellar (@StellarOrg) January 22, 2025 Stellar’s institutional adoption continues to expand. The network has forged major partnerships with global giants like MoneyGram International, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and PayPal, positioning Stellar as a core partner for tokenizing real-world assets and facilitating institutional remittances and payouts. If you want to increase transparency and efficiency, blockchain is the obvious choice. Today, governments, institutions, and businesses rely on the Stellar Disbursement Platform to send and track payments, instantly. @gttyson explains: pic.twitter.com/liarLxuGsC — Stellar (@StellarOrg) May 1, 2025 For instance, PayPal plans to launch its widely anticipated stablecoin PYUSD on the Stellar network. This integration is expected to onboard millions of users into the Stellar ecosystem, especially for cross-border transactions and Pay-Fi (payment-finance) solutions . Further expanding its influence, Visa recently announced support for the Stellar and Avalanche networks, incorporating stablecoins like PYUSD, USDG, and EURC into its international payments framework. This partnership cements Stellar’s role as a key backend layer for next-gen fintech. . @Visa has announced support for the Stellar network to power its global payment engine. Stellar $XLM is the only non proof-of-stake DLT integrated into Visa’s stablecoin platform. https://t.co/iBdxTpTGD5 pic.twitter.com/uhnPp53WY2 — sammie (@lukinsisammie) August 3, 2025 The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) continues to drive development through protocol upgrades. The recent release of Stellar Project 23 , which coincided with a positive price movement for XLM, showcases this ongoing development. Additionally, CAP-67, a structured event generation upgrade, along with new features like Retroactive Events , was featured in Stellar’s July newsletter to improve developer tooling and ecosystem transparency. $XLM/$USDT Builds Rounded Base as Buyers Begin Testing Resistance The 4-hour chart of $XLM reveals a maturing rounded bottom structure that’s pushing into a short-term breakout area near $0.42. The recent move higher from the $0.36 support zone has developed on gradually increasing volume, a sign of organic accumulation rather than purely short liquidations. This sets a different tone from the steep parabolic runs seen earlier in July. The rise in volume over the past few sessions, especially as Stellar’s price approached $0.41, reflects broader participation. That’s an encouraging signs when paired with a clean base formation like this one. $XLM/USDT price chart, August 4 (Source: TradingView) Although the current push is still testing resistance, there are signs of initiative. In the lower time frame volume footprint, we also observed how market participants reacted when the price compresses in a tight range with alternating green and red deltas. On similar structures, the key is not just whether price breaks higher, but whether aggressive buyers step in to follow through. For now, $XLM is showing balanced volume behavior, which supports a continuation bias, but not without a confirmation push. On the momentum front, indicators have turned constructive. RSI has climbed to 56.44, recovering from deeply neutral levels and indicating a mild bullish skew. There’s no divergence, but the slope is positive, and the RSI has crossed its moving average, which tends to precede extension moves. MACD also supports this interpretation. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, while the histogram has flipped green, which indicates that the bullish momentum is picking up for the first time since mid-July. Both indicators still sit in neutral zones, giving room for further upside. Key resistance remains just above at $0.425, which aligns with a previous consolidation area before the July drop. If the price appreciates beyond this level, the next upside target lies near $0.46. Failure to clear $0.415 would keep $XLM in consolidation, though the rounded base structure would remain valid unless price breaks back below $0.384.

2025-08-04 17:30:17,49535098,1754328617,Trump announces new tariffs and massive EU energy commitments,"The European Union (EU) said Monday it’s delaying its planned tariffs on the United States by six months. The duties were originally set to start this week. The European Commission, which speaks for the EU, said the pause is part of a broader deal made between Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump. “On 27 July 2025, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald J. Trump agreed a deal on tariffs and trade,” the EU Commission’s trade spokesperson said. They called the agreement one that brings “stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.” The EU also confirmed it’s working with the U.S. to finalize a Joint Statement, as both leaders agreed in July. The Commission said it would “take the necessary steps to suspend by 6 months the EU’s countermeasures against the U.S., which were due to enter into force on 7 August.” The pause will officially begin on Tuesday, making the move immediate. Trump announces new tariffs and massive EU energy commitments The delay follows Trump’s decision last month to hit most EU goods with a 15% tariff, including cars. That announcement was paired with a statement from the White House claiming the EU would drop its own tariffs on U.S. industrial exports in return. “The EU will remove significant tariffs, including the elimination of all EU tariffs on U.S. industrial goods exported to the EU,” the White House said. Trump didn’t stop there. He also said the 27 EU member countries agreed to buy $750 billion worth of U.S. energy. And on top of that, they’d invest another $600 billion into the U.S., beyond what’s already going in. But nobody has explained who’s actually putting up the money. The EU can’t force private companies to buy U.S. oil or American grain. That part of the deal remains unclear. An EU statement later confirmed that the July 27 deal was a political agreement, not a binding contract. “Beyond taking the immediate actions committed, the EU and the U.S. will further negotiate, in line with their relevant internal procedures, to fully implement the political agreement,” the bloc said. The timing of all this matters. It’s happening as Trump’s broader trade agenda hits another key week. After pushing back deadlines multiple times, Trump just delayed his next round of global tariffs again. The new U.S. duties will now start August 7, not August 1, and will apply to over 60 countries. So far, nobody knows what kind of Joint Statement the EU and the U.S. are putting together. No details have been shared. But the trade spokesperson confirmed both sides are still working on it. For now, the EU’s counter-tariffs are frozen for six months. What happens after that is still wide open. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 sold out early recently. Phase 6 is already live, with the token at $0.035, which is a 16.17% increase from the last phase. Phase 7 of the MUTM presale is going to include a 14.29% rise to $0.04. Investors who enter at this level have a chance of making a 71.43% return on investment when the token reaches $0.06 on launch. MUTM presale has already raised over $14 million in funding and accumulated over 14,800 token holders. XRP Price Update: Holding Near $3 as Broader Focus Shifts XRP is currently trading at $2.98, having recently topped near $3.60 in July before pulling back. Despite relative weakness, XRP remains supported above critical levels around $2.90–$3.00, reinforcing its ability to stay grounded during market fluctuations. Analysts are watching a breakout chart pattern combined with growing institutional sentiment and Ripple’s expanding network usage, which some project could propel price toward $4 to $7+ by year-end if regulatory clarity and ETF developments accelerate. However, risk factors are present: high realized-cap accumulation and daily profit-taking, totaling over $68M in value transfers, could introduce pullback pressure toward $2.50–$2.80, especially if trading volumes weaken. With capital increasingly gravitating toward utility-led DeFi tokens, investor attention is beginning to shift toward protocols like Mutuum Finance. Presale Phase 6 Begins for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance presale is gaining momentum. Over 14,800 investors have invested in the presale and have raised over $14 million. The project is at stage 6 of the presale at $0.035. Investing now will ensure investors a 71.43% Return on Investment. Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto market, not on hype but on utility and scale security, with its innovative dual-lending platform and soon-to-launch USD-pegged stablecoin. Security First: Mutuum Finance Rolls Out $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has recently introduced a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK for a reward of $50,000 USDT. It’s a four-tier reward program i.e., critical, major, minor and low where each level of vulnerability has a reward. This is yet another aspect that says volumes about how forward-thinking Mutuum is in regard to building trust in the middle of good infrastructure and good security. $100K Reward: Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway . 10 participants will receive $10,000 MUTM. In addition to introducing new investors to the project, the giveaway also shows the project’s bid to build a long-term and faithful community base. Mutuum Finance liquidity model allows the user with the ease to use his or her funds in a full, decentralized lending process. The two-model strategy implemented on the platform allows more flexibility and higher efficiency like Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Emphasis on Security and Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to introduce a stablecoin, which will be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain network. It will be a secure and stable investment vehicle to avoid risk and volatility that can be associated with algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping into the spotlight. Over $14 million has been raised, with more than 14,800 holders already on board. Add in a $50,000 bug bounty, $100,000 token giveaway, and CertiK audit 95 trust score, and it’s clear this project is built for long-term growth. Before August ends, make your move.

According to its preliminary prospectus, the company plans to offer 20.3 million ordinary shares at a proposed price range of $28.00 to $31.00 per share. Based on that pricing, the offering could raise between $568 million and $629 million. Bullish has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker BLSH. If approved, it would mark one of the largest public market entries by a crypto firm in 2025. According to Reuters, Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.2 billion through its U.S. IPO, based on the upper end of its proposed price range of $31.00 per share. BlackRock and ARK Show Interest—But No Guarantees The filing discloses that BlackRock and ARK Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, have shown non-binding interest in purchasing up to $200 million worth of shares at the offering price. While the involvement of these heavyweight investors could boost confidence, the filing makes clear that their interest is not a formal commitment, and the final allocation is subject to underwriter discretion. Bullish is incorporated as a foreign private issuer under U.S. law, allowing it to benefit from reduced disclosure obligations. Each ordinary share will carry one vote, maintaining a straightforward governance structure. The underwriters also hold a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,045,000 shares, which could increase the total offering by as much as $94 million before underwriting costs.

He said that they have “completely missed the potential of crypto,” which is here to update and improve the financial system. “We welcome the attacks and any other attempts to censor this message, as it just helps it spread,” he noted. Some of the Banned Crypto Adverts Still Run in the UK As of January 2025, illegal crypto ads continue to appear in the United Kingdom despite the FCA’s ban on such adverts targeting UK citizens.

On-chain data shows $2.80 is temporary support, with heavier accumulation below $2.48. Analysts track $3.20 breakout level as XRP consolidates between $2.77 and $3.32. XRP Holds Near $3 After Retreat From July Peak Ripple’s XRP traded close to $3 at press time, gaining 5% in 24 hours. The token has dropped 9% over the past week and remains 18% below its all-time high of $3.65, reached on July 18. During the rally, trading volumes crossed $110 million at peak hours as larger buyers entered the market. The price momentum trimmed after sellers stepped in above $3.03 and triggered a short pullback on profit-takers. In the past 24 hours, XRP traded between $2.83 and $3.03. The token has entered the consolidation phase over the past week with an extended lifetime range of between $2.77 and $3.32. On-Chain Metrics Signal Critical Support Levels Data shared by analyst Ali Martinez shows that XRP’s recent market structure is supported by historical accumulation zones. 1.80 billion XRP, or 2.81% of the circulating supply, was previously acquired at roughly $2.80. This zone acts as a temporary price buffer. A firmer support level is positioned below $2.48, where 1.41 billion XRP, or 2.2% of the supply, changed hands. With lighter historical buying between these two zones, current prices remain exposed to sharper moves if selling intensifies.

Resistance and Support Levels in Focus Market analyst CRYPTOWZRD noted that XRP and XRP/BTC ended their daily sessions in positive territory. The subsequent resistance limits lie at around $3.30 and $3.65. A breakout above $3.65 would establish a new high. Key daily support is at $2.80, with intraday support at 2.83.

A confirmed break above it could drive the price action toward $3.23. Failure to hold that threshold may result in sideways consolidation near the lower support zones. In a post on X, analyst CW added that XRP is currently liquidating short positions after clearing highly leveraged longs. CW noted that a move to $3.06 could trigger a wave of short liquidations, which may increase short-term volatility. Whale Selling Increases Market Pressure Large XRP holders have shifted strategy since the July peak. Whales sold more than 700 million XRP worth over $2.1 billion within a single day. These disposals add to immediate selling pressure and can influence smaller market participants to exit positions.

2025-08-04 07:16:12,49510089,1754291772,Cardano Development Team Secures Approval for 96M ADA to Advance Network Upgrades,"Cardano’s core development team, Input Output Global (IOG), has secured the green light from the community to receive 96 million ADA, worth approximately $71 million, to support a year-long series of upgrades. Key Takeaways: Cardano’s community approved 96M ADA in milestone-based funding for core development. Oversight will include monthly reports, smart contracts, and governance by Intersect. Planned upgrades aim to boost scalability, reduce costs, and improve developer tools. The proposal passed with a 74% approval rate , garnering 200 votes in favor, six against, and seven abstentions. The vote marks the first time the Cardano community has directly approved treasury funding for core development. Cardano Ties 96M ADA Funding to Milestone Delivery The funding, which will be released in stages, is tied to delivery milestones overseen by Intersect, a member-based governance body for the Cardano ecosystem. IOG will be required to submit monthly progress reports, detailed timesheets, and quarterly budget breakdowns. Smart contracts and a dedicated committee will provide additional layers of oversight to ensure accountability. Among the planned upgrades are enhancements to Hydra, Cardano’s scalability protocol designed for high-speed, low-cost transactions. Project Acropolis, another major initiative, aims to redesign the Cardano node to make it more modular and developer-friendly, key to attracting and onboarding new core contributors. IOG also plans to implement performance improvements to reduce RAM usage and operating costs for stake pool operators, while laying the groundwork for more advanced smart contract capabilities and seamless interoperability with other chains. Currently, Cardano processes blocks in an average of 20 seconds, with a transaction cost of around 0.34 ADA, according to blockchain analytics firm Messari. The proposed upgrades are expected to make the network more competitive and cost-efficient. While the proposal ultimately passed, it did draw scrutiny from several community members. Today, the @IntersectMBO Board of Directors has to resolve a difficult situation. If you are a DRep engaged in the Budget Reconciliation Process, you already know that members of the Intersect Technical Steering Committee (TSC) have put forth a proposal outlining their vision… — Adam Rusch (@AdamRusch) April 28, 2025 Concerns centered around the size of the funding request, a perceived lack of transparency regarding how resources would be allocated, and whether breaking the proposal into smaller, separately voted sections would have been more appropriate. A competing proposal from Cardano’s Technical Steering Committee was submitted but not endorsed by Intersect. Intersect board member Adam Rusch emphasized that it was up to the community to choose the direction forward. Cardano, Solana, Ethereum Lead 2025 Blockchain Upgrade Wave Cardano joins other major blockchain networks rolling out upgrades this year. Solana recently increased its block capacity by 20% to 60 million compute units. Ethereum, meanwhile, raised its gas limit to nearly 45 million and implemented the Pectra hard fork in May, with further upgrades planned for 2025. Last month, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said an audit of Input Output Global’s (IOG) ADA holdings is nearly ready for public release , with plans to livestream the full report once finalized. The audit follows a wave of accusations leveled earlier this year, including claims that Hoskinson misappropriated $600 million in ADA through manipulation of the Cardano ledger. One allegation, made by NFT artist Masato Alexander, accused Hoskinson of using a “genesis key” to seize control of $619 million during Cardano’s 2021 Allegra hard fork. Hoskinson has denied the allegations.

2025-08-04 07:15:37,49510645,1754291737,Ethena’s USDe expands by 75% as growth turns vertical in July,"Ethena’s USDe expanded by 75% as growth turned nearly vertical in July. The stablecoin surpassed SkyProtocol’s USDS to become the third-largest stablecoin by supply. Ethena’s USDe expanded its supply rapidly, leaving the months of supply crunch behind. For the past month, USDe grew by 75%, for a total market cap of $9.69B. The USDe supply expanded rapidly in November 2024, leading up to the December peak market. The current expansion may suggest additional months of crypto rallies, based on more reliable sentiment and liquidity. The supply of USDe increased to a new record as Ethena’s model is the strongest during ETH rallies. | Source: DeFi Llama The chief reason for the new minting is the directed move of ETH, rising above $3,800 in the past month. With that scenario, Ethena’s earnings model works better, allowing the platform to support a larger USDe supply. For most of 2025, Ethena kept its USDe supply at a conservative baseline, while ETH dipped under $2,000. The month of favorable conditions led to immediate minting, adding over 4B tokens to the total supply. Almost all other stablecoins expanded in the past weeks, with the total supply adding another $1.96B for the past seven days. USDe is now ahead of previously highly active stablecoins like Binance’s FDUSD. The token also supports several pairs on Curve Finance, trading against USDC, as well as niche stabelcoins FraxUSD and mkUSD. USDe takes over both centralized and decentralized markets One of the chief boosts for USDe comes from Bybit, which now carries over 30% of the token’s trading. Another 20% of the token’s activity is based on Uniswap V3 pairs. Part of the growth of USDe is its improved reputation, which has allowed the asset to become a part of multiple ecosystems. USDe is one of the few synthetic stablecoins to establish a supply close to 10B and shift to both DeFi and general trading. The main attractor for USDe is its staking capability, as sUSDe currently trades at a premium. Over the past year, the premium expanded, from $1.08 to $1.19, with constant growth. However, unstaking sUSDe depends on market conditions, with waiting time expanding if too many traders demand their assets. The supply of sUSDe has also grown to over 5.22B, suggesting currently USDe has around $4B in free supply for other operations. ENA trades near three-month highs Ethena’s native token ENA traded close to its three-month highs at $0.60. The token peaked at $0.68 at the end of July, reflecting the overall market activity. ENA expanded on expectations of an ‘Ethena summer’, showing increased trust in DeFi during the 2025 bull market. The project has also shown it is capable of deflating in a controllable manner during market corrections, without causing outsized contagion. Currently, USDe is in demand for its average APY of 8.85%, which would be possible only during favorable conditions for ETH. The general ETH bullishness is the main factor behind Ethena’s success. In early July, the APY was lower at 3.51%, as the ETH rally was still in its early stages. USDe is still only backed by Ethena’s market conditions, and may be open to liquidations. In this scenario, Ethena will have to reduce the supply again. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-08-04 07:11:18,49510208,1754291478,Pepeto Presale Accelerates as Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whales Ignite Meme Coin Hype,"Shiba Inu’s price is showing signs of life, with whales scooping up 400B SHIB and token burns slashing market supply. Pepeto’s presale is charging ahead, driven by utility features, staking rewards, and strong community enthusiasm. Shiba Inu’s whale moves and price action are amplifying interest in Pepeto’s presale as investors track both coins closely. Shiba Inu is far from its $1 dream, but it remains a crypto market favorite. Its price swings often ripple across the meme coin space. Enter Pepeto, a fresh contender stirring up presale buzz and capturing attention. Its early traction raises a big question: could Pepeto’s presale skyrocket if Shiba Inu hits $1? Shiba Inu Price Action and Whale Power Shiba Inu dipped 1.79% today, hovering near $0.000012. Analyst Joe Swanson has spotted two bullish patterns—a cup-and-handle and a double bottom—hinting at a recovery. “If SHIB holds $0.0000103 and breaks $0.0000171, it could climb to $0.0000239,” Swanson shared in a recent post. Big investors are gearing up. IntoTheBlock data shows whale netflows surged from 26 billion to 422 billion SHIB in a day, with whales snapping up nearly 400 billion tokens. Meanwhile, the SHIB burn rate soared 1,700% over the week, wiping out over 629 billion tokens. These moves tighten supply and pressure sellers. Analysts suggest sustained buying could lock in Shiba Inu’s support. If the price gains steam, Pepeto’s presale could catch a tailwind as investors seek new meme coin prospects. Pepeto Presale Gains Traction Priced at $0.000000144, Pepeto’s presale has already pulled in over $5.8 million. Its tiered pricing model spurs early investment, with rising prices per stage fueling demand. The community is buzzing, and funding is keeping pace. Pepeto’s roadmap prioritizes utility and progress. It’s set to launch PepetoSwap, a zero-fee trading platform, and a cross-chain bridge to unite meme coins across networks. Staking programs reward long-term holders, easing selling pressure during the presale. The project is already showing results. A demo of its exchange has been unveiled to the community, proving Pepeto is on track with its goals. If this momentum holds, the presale could gain even more steam. Could Pepeto Follow SHIB’s Path? If Shiba Inu rockets toward $1, meme coin fever could spike. Pepeto, blending meme appeal with real infrastructure, is poised to capture that excitement. Its low presale price means even modest investments could yield big returns if momentum builds. Pepeto’s tokenomics bolster this potential. Of its 420 trillion tokens, 30% goes to the presale, 30% to staking rewards, with clear shares for marketing, liquidity, and development. A no-trading-tax policy sweetens the deal, attracting long-term holders as the ecosystem grows. With Shiba Inu’s market pull and Pepeto’s rising community, both coins are in the spotlight. A SHIB rally toward $1 could supercharge Pepeto’s presale, shaping a major 2025 narrative. Key Takeaway Shiba Inu’s $1 goal is uncertain, but its whale buys and token burns are fueling optimism in the meme coin space.

2025-08-04 07:07:16,49510673,1754291236,Mutuum Finance may break $1 before BTC hits new all-time high,"Unlike meme-driven tokens with no underlying substance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the DeFi arena with a fresh yet utility-driven protocol. It’s preparing to launch a multi-layered platform that combines overcollateralized borrowing, mtToken staking, and an interest-bearing stablecoin. With a beta release scheduled to roll out at listing and major exchange visibility expected, all signs point toward an aggressive demand wave that could push MUTM well past its initial targets, possibly even touching $1 before Bitcoin (BTC) reclaims its previous high. A new contender backed by functionality At the time of writing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its ongoing presale, priced at just $0.035 per token. With 7% of this round’s allocation already acquired and over $13.85 million raised across earlier phases, investor momentum is building. This phase has a hard allocation of 170 million tokens, and once it’s fully subscribed, the price will jump by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. Early adopters who swapped $2,000 worth of AVAX back in Phase 1 at $0.01 are already sitting on a 3.5x gain. With listing price confirmed at $0.06, that gain will widen to 6x. But what’s truly striking is that a $0.01 buy reaching $1 equals a 100x return. As more buyers enter with the listing on the horizon, a token like MUTM—which operates in a sector poised for mainstream usage—can’t stay underpriced for long. What sets this project apart is not just the price action, but the architecture it’s about to deploy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to introduce its smart contract-powered borrowing and lending ecosystem. The system will function through two parallel models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Under the P2C model, users will be able to lend popular assets such as ETH, USDT, or BTC into non-custodial pools. For instance, a user depositing $4,000 worth of ETH into the lending pool can earn an estimated 7.8% APY, which amounts to $312 annually. On the other side of the transaction, a borrower looking to unlock liquidity will be able to post ETH at a 70% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and access up to $2,800 in stablecoins without selling their assets. This model operates seamlessly, with rates adjusting automatically based on pool usage, meaning it’s fully passive for lenders and instantly accessible for borrowers. Meanwhile, the P2P system will allow users to negotiate private loan terms directly with one another. This model is designed for those seeking custom deals or looking to collateralize riskier altcoins that may not be eligible for P2C. With this flexibility, the platform addresses a wider range of DeFi participants—from casual users to sophisticated traders—creating a flywheel of organic engagement. Price explosion likely upon beta launch and listings What’s building even more excitement is that none of these features are live yet—everything is being launched at listing. With the beta version of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s protocol set to drop right alongside the token’s debut on the market, the timing couldn’t be more strategic. Beta users will be among the first to test lending, borrowing, and mtToken staking—all at a time when visibility will be exploding, thanks to the listing on multiple exchanges. As word spreads and functionality goes live, it’s realistic to expect more users interacting with the platform, locking assets, and minting the soon-to-launch stablecoin. The added buzz of expected listings on major exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, MEXC, or Coinbase will significantly expand awareness. New users entering via these top-tier exchanges will encounter a project not only promising utility but delivering on it in real time. And when buyers see a live product with working systems and a fully diluted valuation still under hundreds of millions at launch, demand will inevitably rise. The utility and roadmap are further reinforced by strong community activity—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already boasts over 12,000 followers on Twitter, a $100,000 giveaway for early supporters, and a $50,000 bug bounty partnership with CertiK. Its security ratings are also solid: a 95.00 Token Scan Score and 78.00 Skynet rating, validating its technical groundwork. With so many catalysts converging at once—beta release, staking, stablecoin launch, lending models, exchange listings—there’s a compelling case that MUTM might cross the $1 threshold even before Bitcoin enters its final bullish phase. For those entering at the current $0.035 price, the upside is undeniable. The window is still open—but not for long.

According to the data, a wallet holding just over 2,486 XRP now places its owner in the top 10% of XRP accounts. Furthermore, a balance of 50,637 XRP is enough to rank within the top 1% of wallets by holdings. The chart shared by Squire, originally compiled from publicly available ledger data, breaks down the XRP distribution into percentage brackets ranging from the top 0.01% to the top 10%. At the extreme top, only 663 wallets qualify for the 0.01% tier, each holding over 5.73 million XRP. The 0.1% bracket includes wallets with at least 369,080 XRP, while 0.5% of wallets hold over 100,000 XRP. According to the chart, the top 1% begins at just over 50,637 XRP. $XRP Rich List just dropped 2,500 XRP puts you in the top 10%. 50,650 XRP? That’s the 1% club. Still think you're ""just getting started""? Check again. You might already be ahead of 99%. pic.twitter.com/V3RD3XYadY — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 3, 2025 Squire’s View: Many XRP Holders Underestimate Their Position Squire commented that many XRP holders might underestimate their positioning within the broader ecosystem. He suggested that some individuals who believe they are “just getting started” may already be ahead of 99% of accounts based on the current wallet data. This sentiment, intended to motivate holders, was grounded in the interpretation of the wallet distribution figures. However, the data has also prompted scrutiny from several users within the XRP community who questioned its accuracy and usefulness. Community Pushback on Wallet-Based Metrics One user, identified as PAPA2MAXX, argued that the figures provided in the list may not present a clear or reliable picture of actual ownership distribution. According to this user, many individuals hold XRP across multiple wallets, which significantly skews the data. They further claimed that the number of people truly holding over 50,000 XRP is much smaller than the list implies, estimating it to be closer to around 1,200 individuals rather than the 66,330 accounts identified as representing the top 1%. Another community member, DanielThaLion, echoed this concern by stating that he holds XRP across five different wallets. He also emphasized that many of the highest-balance wallets are custodial accounts owned by centralized exchanges. These large wallets may represent the combined assets of thousands of users, but in such reports, they are treated as single wallet holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additionally, users who store their XRP on exchanges do not appear individually on such lists, as their balances are aggregated into exchange wallets, further distorting the actual distribution of wealth among individual holders. Challenges in Assessing Ownership Distribution These concerns highlight a broader challenge in interpreting blockchain data for asset distribution. Wallet count does not equate to individual holders, and the presence of multi-wallet users and exchange custodians significantly complicates any attempt to assess wealth concentration. While John Squire’s update presents a factual breakdown of wallet balances based on ledger data, it may not fully represent the distribution of XRP ownership across individuals. Nevertheless, the figures remain useful as a general benchmark for understanding wallet stratification. According to the data, wallets holding at least 16,299 XRP are within the top 3%, while those with 8,758 XRP make it into the top 5%. The 10% mark, as referenced by Squire, stands at just above 2,486 XRP. This positioning framework provides a comparative look at holdings, although it cannot offer a definitive picture of how many individuals hold these balances.

In a new interview on the Goldman Sachs YouTube channel, Anshul Sehgal, the bank’s co-head of fixed income, currency and commodities, says that the future looks bright for markets as tailwinds from the US, China and Germany. “In 2026, we are seeing nothing but good news for the global economy. You’ve got Germany fiscally expanding because of defense, you’ve got [Trump’s] big beautiful bill, which has potential, especially in conjunction with AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics, to unleash a credit boom domestically in addition to the fiscal expansion we’ve witnessed over the last four years. Similarly, [we expect] China to continue to hold on to its perch in AI and robotics [and is] already expanding in both credit and fiscal terms. So the combination of those things globally essentially means that you’re going to get asset price appreciation in the intermediate term.” Sehgal goes on to say that in the near term, tariffs will likely create a one-time setback for the markets as either corporations or consumers will have to take the hit. “In the very near-term, because tariffs are on corporations, if they absorb the losses – the number we’re talking about is $250 billion to $300 billion annualized – based on where things are falling, that’s about 1% of the GDP, it’s a non-trivial amount. That, if it’s absorbed by the corporates, would have an impact on stocks, and if it’s absorbed by the consumer, it would impact consumption in the near term. It is a one-time tax, though, so once it’s factored and starting early next year, once you’ve got the bonus depreciation that’s in the big beautiful bill, you’ve got the social security tax benefits and the lower taxes on tips. The combination of those things are very powerful for the US economy in our view.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-08-04 06:55:10,49509342,1754290510,Bitcoin Reserves: Capital B’s Strategic $13.3 Million Raise Fuels BTC Growth,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserves: Capital B’s Strategic $13.3 Million Raise Fuels BTC Growth In a significant move echoing growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Capital B, a publicly listed company based in Europe, has recently announced a substantial fundraising round. The primary objective? To bolster its Bitcoin reserves . This strategic decision highlights a broader trend of traditional companies increasingly integrating cryptocurrencies into their balance sheets, recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. What’s Driving Capital B’s Bitcoin Reserves Strategy? Capital B’s recent capital raise of approximately €11.5 million ($13.3 million) to expand its Bitcoin holdings, as reported by NLNico (@btcNLNico) on X, isn’t just a financial transaction; it’s a statement. This move underscores several key motivations that are becoming increasingly common among forward-thinking corporations: Inflation Hedging: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply, making it an attractive asset for preserving purchasing power. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin is often dubbed “digital gold” due to its scarcity and perceived store-of-value properties, making it a compelling alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Strategic Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries provides diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Investor Demand: A growing number of institutional and retail investors are seeking exposure to Bitcoin, and companies holding BTC can attract this segment of the market. This commitment to increasing Bitcoin reserves reflects a sophisticated understanding of evolving financial landscapes. How Does Increasing Bitcoin Reserves Impact a Public Company? For a publicly listed entity like Capital B, the decision to accumulate significant Bitcoin reserves carries both opportunities and responsibilities. It signals a progressive approach to treasury management, but also requires careful consideration of market volatility and regulatory environments. Consider the following aspects: Aspect Opportunity Consideration Market Perception Innovator, forward-thinking Potential for investor skepticism Balance Sheet Strength Asset appreciation potential Volatility impact on financials Operational Costs Reduced inflation erosion Custody and security expenses Regulatory Landscape Potential for clear guidelines Evolving regulations, compliance The successful execution of this strategy will depend on Capital B’s ability to navigate the complexities of digital asset management while maintaining transparency with its shareholders regarding its Bitcoin reserves . What Are the Broader Implications for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Capital B’s move is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger narrative of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. From MicroStrategy’s pioneering corporate treasury strategy to Tesla’s past Bitcoin acquisitions, the trend of companies adding BTC to their balance sheets is gaining momentum. This growing institutional embrace has several significant implications: Legitimization of Crypto: Each new corporate adoption lends further credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond speculative investment. Increased Liquidity: As more institutions hold Bitcoin, it contributes to deeper market liquidity, potentially reducing price volatility over time. Infrastructure Development: Institutional demand drives the development of more robust and secure custody solutions, trading platforms, and financial products for digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: The presence of established companies in the crypto space often prompts regulators to develop clearer guidelines, fostering a more stable environment for all participants. The strategic decision to build substantial Bitcoin reserves by a European publicly listed company serves as a powerful testament to the digital asset’s enduring appeal and growing acceptance in mainstream finance. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses Regarding Bitcoin Reserves For individuals and businesses watching these developments, Capital B’s action provides valuable insights into the evolving investment landscape. It underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s role in modern portfolios. Here are some actionable takeaways: Research and Due Diligence: Before considering any Bitcoin investment, whether personal or corporate, conduct thorough research into its fundamentals, market dynamics, and associated risks. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin can offer significant upside, it should generally be part of a diversified portfolio, rather than the sole investment. Long-Term Perspective: Many institutional investors, including those building Bitcoin reserves , adopt a long-term view, understanding that short-term volatility is part of the asset’s journey. Security Measures: For businesses holding significant crypto assets, robust security protocols for custody are paramount. This includes multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and professional third-party custodians. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic. Keep abreast of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s value and adoption. Capital B’s move serves as a compelling case study for the increasing integration of digital assets into traditional financial strategies, particularly regarding the strategic accumulation of Bitcoin reserves . Capital B’s successful fundraising of $13.3 million specifically to increase its Bitcoin reserves marks a significant milestone in the ongoing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As a publicly listed European company, its decision sends a strong signal about the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This strategic move highlights Bitcoin’s role as a potential inflation hedge, a diversifier, and a valuable asset in a modern corporate treasury. While the journey of integrating digital assets into traditional finance has its complexities, Capital B’s proactive step exemplifies a forward-thinking approach that could inspire many others. The narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate and powerful financial asset continues to strengthen, driven by such decisive actions from established entities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about companies increasing their Bitcoin reserves : Q1: Why are companies like Capital B increasing their Bitcoin reserves? A1: Companies are increasing their Bitcoin reserves primarily for strategic diversification, as a hedge against inflation, and to capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value. It also signals a progressive stance on digital assets to investors. Q2: Is it risky for public companies to hold Bitcoin reserves? A2: Yes, holding Bitcoin does come with risks due to its price volatility. However, companies often weigh these risks against the potential for significant appreciation and the benefits of diversification. Robust risk management and custody solutions are crucial. Q3: How does this impact Bitcoin’s market legitimacy?

2025-08-04 06:54:28,49510573,1754290468,"DOGE Rally Stalls at 20-Cents, But Large Holder Activity Flashes Bullish Signs","DOGE rose 5% during the 24-hour session from August 2 at 21:00 to August 3 at 20:00, climbing from $0.189 to $0.200 before slipping slightly to close at $0.198. The rally was driven by consistent accumulation and large holder activity, with key breakouts at $0.194, $0.196, and $0.198. However, the token failed to maintain momentum above the $0.20 resistance and reversed during the final hour of trading, indicating a short-term top and setting the stage for a potential consolidation phase. What to Know DOGE advanced from $0.189 to $0.200, a 6.17% intraday swing Closed the session at $0.198, up 4.66% Major breakout zones: $0.194, $0.196, $0.198 Strong volume spikes during upward moves exceeded 233 million daily average Late-session pullback from $0.200 to $0.198 with declining momentum News Background DOGE’s move comes amid increased attention on high-volatility tokens as broader markets remain directionless. While bitcoin and ether hold steady, meme coins like DOGE have benefited from retail speculation and opportunistic institutional flows. Large holders reportedly accumulated 310 million DOGE tokens recently, bolstering confidence in the rally despite macro uncertainties.

2025-08-04 06:51:58,49510061,1754290318,"From $0.035 to $3, MUTM could deliver 100x before the bull run peaks","Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Stablecoin and mtToken Mechanics At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a powerful triad: a decentralized stablecoin, interest-bearing mtTokens, and a robust lending engine running on a Layer-2 network. Unlike speculative tokens with little use case, this ecosystem is purpose-built for long-term value generation. When users deposit blue-chip assets like ETH, USDC, or DAI into the protocol, they will receive mtTokens issued on a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens will not just represent ownership—they will grow in value as they accrue interest, and can be staked in smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards from protocol revenue. The demand loop here is clear: as more users deposit to earn yield, the supply of mtTokens will rise. Staking them unlocks MUTM distributions, encouraging users to participate long-term instead of selling. Once the platform goes live, every new deposit and interaction is expected to create positive demand pressure on the MUTM token, reinforcing its market position beyond the listing phase. This isn’t just another DeFi promise—it’s a utility-focused ecosystem ready to tap into the growing appetite for sustainable passive income tools. Presale momentum signals the last entry window Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in Presale Phase 6, offering tokens at just $0.035. Over $13.85 million has already been raised, with 7% of Phase 6’s 170 million tokens already sold to more than 14,800 holders. The next price increase to $0.040 represents a 15% hike, meaning buyers today already step in at a discount before the official listing price of $0.06. This presale phase is not just a discounted buying opportunity—it’s the last early-entry point before demand could spike significantly. The upcoming beta launch, slated in the roadmap’s next development phase, is expected to introduce real usage into the ecosystem. When users begin interacting with the mtToken staking system and the stablecoin issuance model, the value proposition will become tangible. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is executing a clear 4-phase roadmap that begins with its foundational steps: smart contract auditing, presale tracking, and initial community growth. The protocol has already secured a CertiK audit with strong results—Token Score of 95 and Skynet rating of 78, signaling a serious commitment to security. The next phase focuses on launching the beta version of its lending and staking protocol, followed by stablecoin deployment and full Layer-2 integration. With more than 12,000 Twitter followers already supporting the movement, momentum is building fast. A $100,000 giveaway is live, giving 10 early investors a chance to win $10,000 worth of MUTM each. Engagement is climbing, awareness is spreading—and the clock is ticking for Phase 6 buyers. Why $3 isn’t a stretch for MUTM When comparing early movers to those just entering now, the rewards are already substantial. Investors who converted $5,000 worth of SOL into MUTM during Phase 1 at $0.01 are now holding tokens valued around $30,000—a 6x gain even before listing. But the real upside is ahead. At a projected post-launch price of $3, those same tokens would be worth a staggering $500,000—a full 100x return. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart isn’t hype—it’s structure. Once the beta platform is operational, user interaction will increase. The protocol’s appeal lies in practical utility: earning APY through mtTokens, participating in P2C lending, and locking assets to mint a decentralized stablecoin. As these features roll out, the demand for MUTM tokens is expected to intensify. Additionally, once MUTM begins listing on major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, or Coinbase, it will gain visibility among millions of traders seeking the next big DeFi breakout. Visibility leads to trust. Trust leads to investment. And investment drives the price upward. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting up for something rare—an actual use-case-driven protocol with a direct path to mass adoption. As Phase 6 quickly sells out, the current entry point may soon become a missed opportunity. With listing not far away and DeFi’s resurgence gaining steam, the road to $3 doesn’t just look possible—it looks earned.

2025-08-04 06:50:11,49509084,1754290211,Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Smarter Web Company’s Bold $10.75M Move,"BitcoinWorld Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Smarter Web Company’s Bold $10.75M Move In the dynamic world of digital finance, a compelling trend is reshaping corporate balance sheets: the adoption of Bitcoin. Companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets to embrace the potential of cryptocurrencies. One such player making waves is the U.K.-based web development firm, Smarter Web Company (SWC), which recently made a significant move that underscores the growing interest in a strategic Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . What is Smarter Web Company’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? Smarter Web Company has announced a remarkable fundraising achievement, securing £8.1 million, equivalent to $10.75 million. This capital was raised through a placing and subscription of nearly 4 million new ordinary shares, each priced at £2.05. But what makes this particular fundraising notable is the stated purpose behind it: to acquire more Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t SWC’s first foray into the world of digital assets. The company had previously outlined its intention to invest in Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value and a strategic asset. As of July 30, SWC already held a substantial 2,050 BTC. This new injection of capital is set to significantly bolster their existing Bitcoin reserves, reinforcing their commitment to a long-term Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . The decision by a web development firm to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin speaks volumes about the evolving perception of cryptocurrencies among businesses. It highlights a strategic shift where digital assets are no longer seen as niche investments but as integral components of a diversified corporate treasury. Why Are Companies Embracing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? Smarter Web Company’s move is part of a broader trend. A growing number of corporations are exploring or implementing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . But what drives this shift? Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s appeal for corporate treasuries: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing inflation concerns, Bitcoin is viewed by many as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply offer a compelling alternative to traditional monetary systems. Digital Gold Narrative: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with the precious metal, such as scarcity and durability. Companies are looking to Bitcoin to preserve capital in the long term. Balance Sheet Optimization: For some, holding Bitcoin is a way to optimize their balance sheet, potentially generating returns that outpace traditional low-yield investments while diversifying asset exposure. Market Trend and Innovation: Aligning with the cutting edge of financial innovation can also be a driver. Companies that embrace digital assets are often seen as forward-thinking and adaptable. To better understand the motivations, let’s look at a simplified comparison of traditional cash holdings versus a Bitcoin allocation: Aspect Traditional Cash Holdings Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Inflation Exposure High (Purchasing power erosion) Potential Hedge (Fixed supply) Yield Potential Low (Bank interest) High (Price appreciation) Volatility Low High Accessibility High Varies (Custody solutions) Navigating the Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, adopting a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy is not without its challenges. Companies must carefully consider potential hurdles to ensure a robust and secure investment: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings. Corporations must be prepared for the potential for substantial unrealized gains or losses on their balance sheets, which can impact quarterly earnings reports and investor perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions. Changes in regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or operational aspects of holding digital assets. Custody and Security: Securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and robust security protocols to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. This often necessitates partnerships with professional custodians. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment for Bitcoin holdings can be complex and varies by region. Companies need expert advice to correctly report their digital assets and manage tax obligations. These challenges underscore the importance of thorough due diligence and a well-thought-out plan before embarking on a significant Bitcoin investment. Beyond Smarter Web: Other Pioneers in Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Smarter Web Company is certainly a notable example, but they stand on the shoulders of other corporate giants who have paved the way for a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . Perhaps the most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value has inspired many other firms. Another well-known case is Tesla, which famously invested a substantial amount in Bitcoin and briefly accepted it for payments, though their strategy has seen some adjustments. Similarly, Block (formerly Square), led by Jack Dorsey, has also made significant Bitcoin purchases and is actively involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem through initiatives like Bitcoin mining and decentralized exchange development. These examples illustrate that the decision to integrate Bitcoin into corporate treasuries is not limited to tech firms or crypto-native companies; it’s a strategic consideration for a diverse range of industries. Actionable Insights for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy What does Smarter Web Company’s latest move, and the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption, mean for the market and for other businesses considering a similar path? Here are some key takeaways: Increasing Institutional Validation: Each new corporate entry into Bitcoin adds further legitimacy to the asset class, potentially attracting more traditional investors and reducing perceived risk. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Companies are actively seeking alternatives to traditional cash and bond holdings to protect against inflation and seek growth. Bitcoin offers a unique proposition in this regard. Importance of Risk Management: For any company considering a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy , comprehensive risk assessment, robust security measures, and clear accounting practices are paramount. Long-Term Vision: Most corporate Bitcoin investors are taking a long-term view, understanding that short-term volatility is part of the asset’s nature. Their strategy is often about preserving purchasing power over years, not months. The landscape of corporate finance is undoubtedly shifting. As more companies like Smarter Web Company commit capital to Bitcoin, they are not just making an investment; they are signaling a profound belief in the future of decentralized digital assets. Smarter Web Company’s successful fundraising and subsequent plan to increase its Bitcoin holdings mark a significant milestone in the ongoing story of corporate cryptocurrency adoption. Their bold move highlights a growing confidence among businesses in Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset. While challenges exist, the potential benefits of an innovative Corporate Bitcoin Strategy , from inflation hedging to balance sheet optimization, are proving increasingly attractive to forward-thinking firms. As the digital economy continues to evolve, we can expect more companies to follow suit, reshaping the future of corporate finance one Bitcoin acquisition at a time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? A Corporate Bitcoin Strategy involves a company intentionally acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves or investment portfolio, often to hedge against inflation, diversify assets, or capitalize on potential appreciation. Q2: Why did Smarter Web Company raise funds specifically for Bitcoin purchases? Smarter Web Company raised $10.75 million to expand its existing Bitcoin holdings, demonstrating a clear strategic decision to invest further in digital assets for long-term value preservation and potential growth. Q3: What are the main benefits for a company adopting Bitcoin? Key benefits include acting as an inflation hedge, potential for significant capital appreciation, diversification of treasury assets away from traditional low-yield options, and signaling innovation to the market. Q4: What are the risks associated with a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? Risks include high price volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, the complexities of secure custody, and challenging accounting and tax implications. Companies must implement robust risk management. Q5: Are other companies also adopting a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? Yes, prominent examples include MicroStrategy, which holds substantial Bitcoin, and Block (formerly Square), which has also made significant Bitcoin investments and is active in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Q6: How does Bitcoin’s fixed supply benefit a corporate treasury?

2025-08-04 06:45:10,49508905,1754289910,South Korea Stablecoin: Revolutionary Progress in Digital Payments,"BitcoinWorld South Korea Stablecoin: Revolutionary Progress in Digital Payments The digital payment landscape in South Korea is on the cusp of a significant transformation. As global interest in stablecoins intensifies, major players in the nation’s tech and finance sectors are making strategic moves to integrate these digital assets into everyday transactions. The spotlight is currently on the burgeoning efforts to launch a South Korea stablecoin , particularly one pegged to the Korean Won (KRW). This initiative promises to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, offering new possibilities for efficiency and accessibility in payments. Recent reports indicate that mobile financial platform Toss, a product of Viva Republica, is engaging in discussions with leading crypto exchange Bithumb. Their objective? To develop a stablecoin-based payment system. This mirrors a similar, high-profile collaboration already underway between Naver Pay, the digital payment arm of internet giant Naver, and Upbit, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange operated by Dunamu. These parallel developments signal a robust and competitive push towards establishing a dominant KRW-pegged stablecoin, potentially reshaping how South Koreans manage and spend their money. What is Driving the South Korea Stablecoin Rush? South Korea has long been a global leader in technological adoption and digital innovation. Its citizens are highly accustomed to mobile payments and online transactions, creating a fertile ground for the evolution of digital currency. The nation’s advanced digital infrastructure and high internet penetration rates make it an ideal testbed for new financial technologies like a South Korea stablecoin . Several factors are fueling this intense interest and development: Technological Readiness: South Korea boasts one of the world’s most digitally connected populations, with widespread use of mobile banking and payment apps. This existing comfort with digital transactions provides a strong foundation for stablecoin adoption. Government and Regulatory Stance: While cautious, South Korean regulators have shown an increasing willingness to explore blockchain and digital assets. Clearer regulatory frameworks are emerging, providing a more stable environment for innovation. Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Stablecoins offer the potential for faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions compared to traditional payment rails, especially for cross-border remittances. Competitive Landscape: The race between giants like Toss/Bithumb and Naver/Upbit reflects a recognition of stablecoins as a future pillar of the digital economy. No major player wants to be left behind in this evolving financial landscape. Here is a comparison of the key players and their reported stablecoin initiatives: Entity Key Partner(s) Reported Initiative Potential Impact Toss (Viva Republica) Bithumb Stablecoin-based payment system Integrate crypto into daily mobile finance Naver Pay (Naver) Upbit (Dunamu) KRW-pegged stablecoin collaboration Leverage e-commerce giant’s user base for adoption How Will a KRW-Pegged South Korea Stablecoin Function? A South Korea stablecoin pegged to the Korean Won would function similarly to other fiat-backed stablecoins like USDT or USDC, but with the specific backing of KRW. This means that for every stablecoin issued, an equivalent amount of Korean Won would be held in reserve, ensuring its price stability. This stability is crucial, as it mitigates the notorious volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies, making stablecoins suitable for everyday transactions and financial services. The potential applications for a KRW-pegged stablecoin are vast and varied: Daily Payments and E-commerce: Imagine paying for groceries or online shopping using a digital KRW stablecoin directly from your mobile wallet, with transactions settling almost instantly. Remittances: Sending money to or from South Korea could become significantly faster and cheaper, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries and their associated fees and delays. Cross-border Trade: Businesses could use stablecoins for international payments, reducing foreign exchange risks and transaction costs. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are a cornerstone of DeFi, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn yield in a stable environment without exposure to volatile assets. The benefits extend beyond mere convenience. A widely adopted South Korea stablecoin could foster greater financial inclusion by providing accessible digital financial services to a broader population, including those who may be underserved by traditional banking systems. It could also enhance the transparency of financial flows, as transactions on a blockchain are immutable and verifiable. What Challenges Lie Ahead for South Korea Stablecoin Projects? While the prospects for a South Korea stablecoin are promising, several significant challenges must be addressed for successful implementation and widespread adoption. These hurdles span regulatory, technical, and societal dimensions: Regulatory Clarity and Oversight: The biggest challenge remains the evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide, including South Korea, are grappling with how to classify and regulate stablecoins. Questions persist regarding consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. The potential for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) also adds a layer of complexity, as private stablecoins would need to coexist or integrate with national digital currency initiatives. Trust and Adoption: Despite South Korea’s tech-savviness, building public trust in a new digital currency requires significant effort. Users need assurance about the stability of the peg, the security of their funds, and the reliability of the underlying technology. Education and transparent communication will be vital. Technological Scalability and Interoperability: For a stablecoin to handle millions of daily transactions, the underlying blockchain infrastructure must be highly scalable and robust. Furthermore, ensuring interoperability with existing financial systems and other blockchain networks is crucial for seamless integration and broad utility. Competition with Existing Payment Systems: South Korea already has a highly efficient and entrenched digital payment ecosystem. Stablecoins must offer compelling advantages in terms of speed, cost, or unique features to truly displace or significantly augment established payment methods like credit cards, bank transfers, and existing mobile payment apps. Reserve Management and Auditing: Maintaining the KRW peg requires meticulous management of reserves, which must be fully backed and regularly audited by independent third parties to ensure transparency and prevent systemic risks. Actionable Insights: Navigating the South Korea Stablecoin Landscape The emergence of a South Korea stablecoin presents both opportunities and considerations for various stakeholders. Understanding these dynamics can help individuals and businesses prepare for the future of digital finance: For Consumers: Stay informed about developments. While the convenience of stablecoins is appealing, understand the underlying technology and the entities issuing them. Look for stablecoins that are fully backed by transparent reserves and regulated by appropriate authorities. Consider how stablecoins could simplify your daily transactions or cross-border payments. For Businesses: Explore the potential for integrating stablecoin payments into your operations. This could include accepting stablecoins for goods and services, streamlining supply chain payments, or facilitating international transactions. Early adopters may gain a competitive edge by offering more efficient and potentially cheaper payment options to customers. Consider partnering with payment processors or platforms that support stablecoin transactions. For Developers and Innovators: The push for a South Korea stablecoin creates new opportunities for building innovative applications and services on top of these digital currencies. This could range from new payment gateways to DeFi protocols tailored for the KRW market. Focus on user experience, security, and compliance. For Regulators and Policymakers: Continue to foster a balanced approach that encourages innovation while ensuring financial stability, consumer protection, and compliance with global standards. Clear guidelines for stablecoin issuance, reserve management, and operational resilience are paramount to building a trusted digital currency ecosystem. The collaborative efforts between major tech and crypto entities underscore a significant shift towards integrating blockchain-based solutions into mainstream finance. The lessons learned from the development of a South Korea stablecoin will undoubtedly provide valuable insights for other nations exploring similar initiatives. In conclusion, the race to launch a KRW-pegged South Korea stablecoin by industry titans like Toss, Bithumb, Naver, and Upbit marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital payments. While challenges remain, the potential for faster, cheaper, and more accessible financial services is immense. This ambitious undertaking not only positions South Korea at the forefront of digital currency innovation but also sets a precedent for how traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology can converge to create a more efficient and interconnected global economy. The coming years will reveal the full impact of these revolutionary developments on daily life and commerce. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin?

2025-08-04 06:42:45,49510571,1754289765,"Bitcoin Still on Track for $140K This Year, But 2026 Will be Painful: Elliott Wave Expert","Don't call the top yet, market analyst specializing in the Elliott wave theory, told CoinDesk. He added that bitcoin (BTC) will rally to around $140,000 this year before slipping into a bear market in 2026. The leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped 4% over the past week, with prices hitting lows under $112,000 over the weekend, according to CoinDesk data. The decline comes after weeks of profit-taking by long-term holders near $120,000 and alongside sharp losses in key crypto-related stocks such as Strategy (MSTR) and Coinbase (COIN). The sell-off is a typical retracement wave, representing a temporary breather from the preceding bullish impulse wave, and could set the stage for a rally to $140,000 by year-end, according to John Glover, chief investment officer at crypto financial services company Ledn. ""Firmly caught in the summer doldrums, the BTC price continues to follow the expected trajectory and will soon complete the 5-wave move depicted by the blue line [in the chart] below, which will finish wave iii (yellow line) of Wave 5 (orange line). All to say, we're still on target to hit $135,000 - $140,000 by the end of 2025,"" Glover said in an email. What is the Elliott Wave? The Elliott Wave Theory, introduced by Ralph Nelson Elliott in 1938 in his book, "" The Wave Principle , is a way of understanding market movements by recognizing that they follow predictable, repeating patterns like natural fractals. The core idea is that crowd psychology moves in cycles, creating a pattern of five waves in the direction of the primary trend or the impulse move. The five-wave structure encompasses three impulse waves (1,3, and 5) and two retracing waves (2 and 4). Sometimes, impulse waves are extended and powerful, comprising their own 5-wave structure. A three-wave corrective structure follows the five-wave structure. This 5-3 wave pattern repeats at both larger and smaller scales, allowing observers to forecast future price action based on the market's current position within the broader context. According to the above chart, BTC is currently moving in the impulse wave (iii) of the extended impulse wave 5. The impulse wave (iii) could hit a high of $130,000 in the next couple of weeks, before prices drop to around $110,000 in September, completing the retrace wave (iv). After that, the final impulse wave (v) of the larger impulse wave 5 will resume, marking a bull market peak at around $140,000. ""Once we achieve the $140,000-ish region, there will be a LOT of debate as to how much further the market will go, and I'm sure we'll hear the bulls quoting $250,000 to $500,000 in 2026. This is not my thesis as I believe we will enter a bear market for BTC in 2026,"" Glover said. Glover's take contrasts with the popular narrative that institutional adoption through ETFs has broken bitcoin's four-year cycles, which historically indicate a price peak this year followed by an extended bear market.

2025-08-04 06:40:10,49508642,1754289610,UK Crypto Regulation: A Dire Warning as Britain Risks Falling Behind,"BitcoinWorld UK Crypto Regulation: A Dire Warning as Britain Risks Falling Behind The world of digital assets is evolving at an incredible pace, promising to reshape finance as we know it. Yet, a recent stark warning from former U.K. Chancellor George Osborne suggests that Britain is dangerously close to being left behind in this transformative shift. His concerns highlight a critical need for decisive UK crypto regulation , comparing the current situation to the pivotal ‘Big Bang’ financial reforms of the 1980s. For anyone invested in the future of finance, particularly cryptocurrencies, this assessment signals a moment of truth for the UK’s strategic position. Why is UK Crypto Regulation Lagging? George Osborne, a key figure in recent British financial history, did not mince words in his Financial Times op-ed. He specifically called out current Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey for what he perceives as a slow and hesitant approach to crypto and stablecoin policy. His central argument is that while the potential for innovation is immense, the lack of a clear, comprehensive legal framework for UK crypto regulation is stifling progress. Lack of Clear Legal Framework: Osborne emphasizes the absence of a defined legal structure, similar to the clarity provided by the U.S. Congress for its digital asset markets. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to operate and innovate confidently within the UK. Bureaucratic Inertia: The criticism points towards a perceived slowness in decision-making and implementation from key financial authorities. Blaming regulators alone is insufficient, according to Osborne, suggesting a broader systemic issue. Stablecoin Standoff: Despite the Treasury expressing support for stablecoins, concrete progress has been limited. The Bank of England, in particular, remains skeptical about allowing commercial banks to issue them, creating a bottleneck for a crucial segment of the crypto market. This situation creates a challenging environment for those looking to build and invest in the UK’s crypto sector. Without a robust and forward-thinking approach to UK crypto regulation , the nation risks losing out on the economic benefits and technological advancements that other jurisdictions are actively pursuing. The ‘Big Bang’ Analogy: A Call for Transformative UK Crypto Regulation Osborne’s comparison of the crypto sector’s potential to the ‘Big Bang’ reforms of the 1980s is significant. Those reforms deregulated London’s financial markets, leading to a massive expansion of the city’s global financial services industry. If crypto holds similar transformative power, then the current cautious stance on UK crypto regulation could be seen as a missed opportunity of historical proportions. Consider the parallels: Aspect 1980s ‘Big Bang’ Current Crypto Landscape Driving Force Technological advancements (e.g., electronic trading) and global competition Blockchain technology, decentralization, digital assets, tokenization Key Action Deregulation, abolition of fixed commissions, opening to foreign firms Need for clear legal frameworks, consumer protection, innovation support Potential Outcome (Positive) London’s rise as a global financial hub UK as a leader in Web3, fintech, and digital asset innovation Risk of Inaction Loss of competitiveness to other financial centers Talent drain, reduced investment, missed economic opportunities The core message is clear: if the UK wants to maintain its standing as a leading financial center, it must embrace the digital asset revolution with the same boldness it showed in the 1980s. Proactive UK crypto regulation is not just about managing risk; it’s about seizing opportunity. What are the Challenges for Effective UK Crypto Regulation? While the call for action is strong, implementing effective UK crypto regulation is not without its complexities. The very nature of decentralized finance presents unique challenges for traditional regulatory bodies. A symbolic representation of the challenges faced in crafting modern financial regulations for digital assets. UK Crypto Regulation: A Dire Warning as Britain Risks Falling Behind Some of the key hurdles include: Defining Digital Assets: Classifying various crypto assets (e.g., utility tokens, security tokens, stablecoins, NFTs) under existing legal frameworks is a complex task. Different classifications imply different regulatory treatments. Jurisdictional Arbitrage: The global, borderless nature of crypto means that overly restrictive regulations in one jurisdiction can simply push innovation and talent to more welcoming shores. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Regulators must strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation, protecting consumers from scams and market volatility, and preventing illicit financial activities. This requires deep understanding and agility. Technological Pace: The rapid evolution of blockchain technology and new crypto applications means that regulations can quickly become outdated. A flexible, principles-based approach may be more effective than rigid, prescriptive rules. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between government, regulators, and the industry itself. A ‘wait and see’ approach risks creating a regulatory vacuum that benefits no one. Actionable Insights: Paving the Way for Robust UK Crypto Regulation Osborne’s critique isn’t just about identifying problems; it’s a plea for proactive solutions. So, what steps can be taken to accelerate UK crypto regulation and ensure Britain remains competitive? Here are some actionable insights: Establish a Dedicated Task Force: Create a cross-governmental and cross-regulatory body with a clear mandate and timeline to develop and implement a comprehensive digital asset strategy. This task force should include industry experts. Prioritize Stablecoin Legislation: Given their potential to bridge traditional finance and the crypto world, clear and robust regulation for stablecoins should be fast-tracked. This includes defining issuer responsibilities, reserve requirements, and consumer protections. Adopt a Phased, Adaptive Approach: Instead of waiting for a perfect, all-encompassing framework, implement regulations in phases, starting with the most critical areas (e.g., stablecoins, custody, anti-money laundering). Build in mechanisms for regular review and adaptation. Learn from Global Leaders: Analyze approaches taken by jurisdictions like the U.S. (with its recent clarity on stablecoins and digital asset definitions) and the EU (with MiCA regulation) to identify best practices and potential pitfalls. Foster Dialogue with the Industry: Regular, open communication between policymakers, regulators, and crypto businesses is crucial to ensure regulations are practical, effective, and do not inadvertently stifle legitimate innovation. By taking these steps, the UK can signal its commitment to becoming a hub for digital asset innovation, attracting investment, fostering job creation, and securing its place in the future of finance. The time for hesitant observation is over; the time for decisive UK crypto regulation is now. Conclusion: Seizing the Moment for UK Crypto Regulation George Osborne’s warning serves as a powerful wake-up call for the United Kingdom. The digital asset revolution is not a distant future but a present reality, and nations that fail to adapt risk being left behind. The comparison to the ‘Big Bang’ underscores the magnitude of the opportunity and the peril of inaction. While challenges exist, the path forward involves clear legal frameworks, agile regulatory responses, and a collaborative spirit between government, regulators, and the burgeoning crypto industry. For Britain to truly capitalize on the potential of this new financial frontier, it must embrace a bold, proactive approach to UK crypto regulation , ensuring it remains at the forefront of global financial innovation rather than watching from the sidelines. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is George Osborne’s main concern regarding UK crypto regulation? George Osborne’s primary concern is that Britain is falling behind other major economies in establishing a clear and comprehensive legal framework for digital assets, particularly stablecoins, which could hinder innovation and economic growth in the crypto sector. What is the ‘Big Bang’ analogy in the context of crypto regulation? The ‘Big Bang’ refers to the significant deregulation of London’s financial markets in the 1980s, which propelled the city into a leading global financial center. Osborne uses this analogy to suggest that crypto has similar transformative potential, and the UK needs a similarly bold regulatory approach to seize it. Why is stablecoin regulation particularly important for the UK? Stablecoins are seen as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, offering stability due to their pegging to fiat currencies or other assets. Clear regulation for stablecoins is crucial for their broader adoption, institutional use, and for facilitating digital payments and financial innovation safely. Who are the key figures being criticized for the slow progress in UK crypto regulation? Former Chancellor George Osborne specifically criticized current Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey for their perceived slow action and cautious stance on crypto and stablecoin policy. What could be the consequences if the UK continues to lag in crypto regulation? If the UK continues to lag, it risks a talent drain, reduced investment in its digital asset sector, and missing out on the significant economic opportunities presented by blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. It could diminish London’s standing as a global financial innovation hub. If you found this insight into UK crypto regulation valuable, please share this article with your network on social media.

2025-08-04 06:32:07,49508353,1754289127,Expert Analysts Share Their Predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices in August,"The cryptocurrency market has been on the rise in the last two months, driven by institutional investments that overshadowed macroeconomic indicators. However, analysts warn that this momentum could reverse in August. New tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, ranging from 10% to 41%, combined with weak employment data, have intensified selling pressure on both traditional and crypto assets. In July, Ethereum (ETH) attracted attention with an impressive 49% surge, while Bitcoin (BTC) surged 8%, reaching a new all-time high mid-month. This rise was fueled by strong investment flows into ETFs. While Bitcoin ETFs continue to see steady inflows, interest in Ethereum-focused funds has surged. The influence of a new generation of treasury companies aiming to accumulate crypto assets has also been notable. However, analysts are expecting a pullback in the crypto market for August, particularly following the widespread sell-off in stocks and the bond rally. “Bitcoin is caught between ETF-fueled optimism and global trade tensions,” said NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef. “Unless a new macro catalyst emerges, it could trade within a narrow price range,” Youssef said, noting that price volatility is expected to be low in August, but investor positions will remain active. Pauline Shangett, ChangeNOW's Director of Strategy, shared a similar view: “I expect Bitcoin to trade within a narrow range in the near term. Ethereum, however, may be more resilient thanks to ETF demand and interest from large investors.” More than $5 billion in inflows into Ethereum ETFs in July brought the total inflow to $9.64 billion. Around $6 billion in new investments were also made into Bitcoin ETFs during the same period. “We're turning this consolidation period into an opportunity,” said Wolfe Research technical analyst Read Harvey. “We expect new momentum and a breakout in the coming weeks.” Harvey argued that pullbacks present buying opportunities and that crypto assets will continue to outperform stocks. Related News: Watch Out: There are a Lot of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up Next Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List According to Ray Youssef, Bitcoin could trade between $114,000 and $120,000 in August, with buying support likely at $103,000-$109,000. For Ethereum, a push to $4,000 is possible as long as it stays above $3,750. However, the $3,200 to $2,900 area remains a strong support area. According to experts, the biggest uncertainty for crypto markets lies in the Fed meeting in September. “Jerome Powell's statements often trigger sudden and sharp price movements,” Youssef said, noting that market sentiment could shift rapidly if geopolitical tensions escalate. However, unless macroeconomic conditions deteriorate dramatically, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to continue gaining momentum below the surface. *This is not investment advice.

Based on the Trump administration’s $3.7 trillion stablecoin plan , an analysis has been put forward that projects a long-term price target of $1.4 million for Bitcoin. How a $3.7 Trillion Stablecoin Market Fuels Bitcoin The analysis, detailed by Chief Bitcoin Strategist Mark Moss, connects the future growth of the stablecoin market directly to Bitcoin’s price. The core idea is that the administration’s plan to grow stablecoin assets under management (AUM) from $250 billion today to $3.7 trillion would unleash a nearly 15x increase in capital flowing through the crypto ecosystem.

2025-08-04 06:30:51,49508350,1754289051,U.S. Debt Will Push Bitcoin to New Highs – And This Altcoin Will Follow,"Bitcoin might be moving sideways now, but the foundations for its next surge could already be in place. While market activity remains slow through the summer months, early investors are already scouting for undervalued opportunities—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly appearing on their radar. The altcoin has been gaining traction as a potential high-ROI investment, just as macro forces begin to favor crypto’s long-term upside . U.S. Debt Adds Fuel to Bitcoin’s Bullish Outlook Matrixport’s latest market outlook argues that Bitcoin’s breakout may arrive sooner than expected—not because of short-term speculation, but due to powerful fiscal trends emerging in the U.S. Government debt continues to spiral upward, with President Donald Trump’s latest proposal to expand the debt ceiling by $5 trillion pushing Treasury obligations into new territory. This sharp rise in borrowing highlights growing concern over long-term monetary risk. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature have always made it attractive in times of economic uncertainty, but this environment may make it essential. Meanwhile, capital keeps flowing into digital assets, particularly Ethereum ETFs and staking platforms, hinting at rising institutional conviction even while retail sentiment stays cautious. The Altcoin That is Positioned as a High-ROI Opportunity Amid the broader market’s consolidation, analysts now spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as a 36x opportunity for forward-thinking investors. The project has seen consistent engagement growth, and its limited supply model paired with ongoing ecosystem development is drawing comparisons to the early phases of top-performing altcoins. Even a small $1,000 allocation could grow into $36,000 , according to current trajectory estimates. With whales and early adopters moving in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most-watched altcoins in the space. More Than Just a Market Pause Though derivatives activity and funding rates suggest a neutral stance from short-term traders, Matrixport believes long-term positioning is steadily shifting in Bitcoin’s favor. The macro environment—driven by expanding debt, inflation fears, and delayed Federal Reserve decisions—is primed for a renewed move into hard assets. If fiscal risks continue to grow, Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge could accelerate, bringing other promising assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE along for the ride. The stage is quietly being set for a much larger crypto resurgence—one driven not by hype, but by structural economic shifts. Conclusion Bitcoin may seem dormant now, but the pressure is building beneath the surface. As the U.S. debt burden expands and institutional money continues flowing into crypto, a major uptrend could emerge in the months ahead. And for investors with an eye on altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 36x potential makes it a compelling choice to ride the next wave of growth.

2025-08-04 06:25:11,49508052,1754288711,Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group’s Bold $2.2M Raise Fuels Crypto Confidence,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group’s Bold $2.2M Raise Fuels Crypto Confidence In a move that underscores the growing confidence in digital assets among traditional businesses, Swedish health-tech firm H100 Group has made headlines with a significant funding round aimed squarely at expanding its cryptocurrency holdings. The company announced it has successfully raised 21.2 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to a substantial $2.2 million, specifically earmarked for further Bitcoin acquisition. This development, initially shared via an X post by @btcNLNico, highlights a fascinating trend: established companies are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies, recognizing its potential as a robust asset. Understanding H100 Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition H100 Group, primarily known for its innovative work in the health-tech sector, might seem like an unconventional player in the Bitcoin space. However, their latest fundraising effort signals a clear, deliberate strategy to bolster their balance sheet with digital assets. As of July 31, the company already held an impressive 685.1 BTC. This new capital infusion is set to significantly increase that figure, positioning H100 Group as a notable corporate holder of Bitcoin. So, why would a health-tech company venture so deeply into the world of Bitcoin acquisition? The reasons are multifaceted and reflect a broader shift in corporate financial planning: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a strong hedge against inflation, especially in an era of quantitative easing and rising global economic uncertainties. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Diversification of Assets: Adding Bitcoin provides a non-correlated asset to a company’s portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk and enhancing returns. It offers a different risk-reward profile compared to conventional investments. Long-Term Value Store: Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold. Companies are looking beyond short-term fluctuations and focusing on its long-term appreciation potential. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking move, aligning a company with the rapidly evolving digital economy. It demonstrates an understanding of future financial landscapes. This strategic move by H100 Group is not an isolated incident. It mirrors a growing trend among publicly traded and private companies globally to allocate portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. This institutional interest is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s maturing status as a legitimate financial asset. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition The decision by H100 Group to actively pursue further Bitcoin acquisition places them among a growing cohort of companies that have embraced the leading cryptocurrency. This trend gained significant momentum during the last few years, with several high-profile companies making substantial Bitcoin investments. Here’s a brief look at some of the pioneering entities and the rationale behind their decisions: Company Primary Motivation for Bitcoin Acquisition MicroStrategy Primary treasury reserve asset, inflation hedge, long-term value store. Tesla Balance sheet diversification, innovation, potential payment method. Block (formerly Square) Strategic investment, support for the crypto ecosystem, financial inclusion. Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin mining company, holding mined Bitcoin as a core strategy. These examples illustrate that the motivations for corporate Bitcoin acquisition are diverse, ranging from treasury management and inflation hedging to strategic alignment with the future of finance. H100 Group’s move reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset for individual investors but a serious consideration for corporate balance sheets. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for the Market? Every instance of significant corporate Bitcoin acquisition sends ripples through the broader cryptocurrency market. Here’s how H100 Group’s latest funding round could impact the ecosystem: Increased Institutional Confidence: When traditional companies, especially those outside the direct crypto industry like H100 Group, publicly commit to Bitcoin, it signals a growing mainstream acceptance. This can attract more institutional investors and even other corporations to explore similar strategies. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As more Bitcoin is moved from exchanges into corporate treasuries, the available supply for trading decreases. This can create upward price pressure, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Market Stability: Corporate holders tend to be long-term investors, often referred to as ‘HODLers’ (Hold On for Dear Life). Their accumulation of Bitcoin can contribute to greater market stability by reducing selling pressure during market downturns. Regulatory Scrutiny and Clarity: The increasing involvement of corporations in Bitcoin acquisition may also prompt regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, which could ultimately benefit the entire crypto industry by fostering a more predictable environment. While the $2.2 million raised by H100 Group might seem modest compared to the multi-billion dollar acquisitions by giants like MicroStrategy, each new corporate entry adds to the cumulative institutional demand, gradually solidifying Bitcoin’s position in the global financial landscape. Challenges and Considerations in Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition Despite the evident benefits, corporate Bitcoin acquisition is not without its challenges. Companies embarking on this path must navigate several complexities: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet. Managing this volatility requires a robust risk management strategy. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Companies must stay abreast of changing laws and ensure compliance. Custody and Security: Safely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise in digital asset custody. Companies must implement stringent security measures to protect their holdings from hacks or loss. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for Bitcoin on a company’s balance sheet can be complex due to its classification as an intangible asset and the need to mark it to market value. H100 Group, like other corporate Bitcoin holders, will need to carefully manage these aspects to ensure their investment strategy remains sound and sustainable. Their continued commitment despite these challenges speaks volumes about their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: An Actionable Insight H100 Group’s successful fundraise for further Bitcoin acquisition serves as a compelling case study for other businesses considering a similar path. It highlights that the appetite for digital assets extends beyond the traditional finance and tech sectors, reaching into diverse industries like health-tech. For investors, this trend suggests a deepening institutional layer supporting Bitcoin’s price and adoption. What actionable insights can we glean from this development? Firstly, corporate adoption is a powerful indicator of Bitcoin’s maturation. It signifies a shift from purely speculative interest to strategic financial planning. Secondly, it underscores the importance of understanding a company’s treasury strategy. Companies that actively manage their balance sheets with innovative assets like Bitcoin may be better positioned for future economic shifts. In conclusion, H100 Group’s $2.2 million raise for more Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving perception of digital assets in the corporate world. It signals a future where Bitcoin is not just a niche investment but a mainstream component of sophisticated financial strategies, driving confidence and innovation across various industries. A company’s decision to invest in Bitcoin reflects a forward-thinking approach to treasury management.

2025-08-04 06:15:10,49507613,1754288110,SYRUP Circulating Supply: Upbit’s Crucial Update Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld SYRUP Circulating Supply: Upbit’s Crucial Update Unveiled In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about tokenomics is paramount. Recently, a significant announcement from Upbit, a leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, caught the attention of many investors, particularly those interested in Maple Finance (SYRUP). Upbit officially communicated that it has updated the SYRUP circulating supply schedule. This adjustment, made at the specific request of the Maple Finance project team, is more than just a procedural change; it signals potential shifts that every SYRUP holder and prospective investor should understand. Understanding the SYRUP Circulating Supply Announcement When an exchange like Upbit announces an update to a token’s circulating supply schedule, it refers to changes in how and when tokens become available in the open market. The circulating supply is a key metric, representing the number of tokens currently accessible to the public and actively traded. It is distinct from the total supply or maximum supply, which include tokens not yet released or those permanently out of circulation. For Maple Finance’s SYRUP token, this update means the planned release of tokens into circulation has been altered. This could involve: Adjusted Vesting Schedules: Changes to how quickly team members, advisors, or early investors receive their allocated tokens. Strategic Reserves: Reallocations from project reserves for new initiatives, partnerships, or ecosystem development. Token Burns: Although less common for schedule adjustments, a burn would permanently remove tokens from the total and circulating supply, impacting scarcity. Liquidity Pool Adjustments: Changes related to tokens provided for liquidity on decentralized exchanges. The crucial detail here is that the adjustment was made at the Maple Finance project team’s request. This suggests a strategic decision by the project itself, rather than an arbitrary move by the exchange. Such requests are often driven by evolving project roadmaps, market conditions, or new strategic directions that necessitate a revised token release plan to better align with long-term goals. Why the SYRUP Circulating Supply Update Matters for Investors The circulating supply of a cryptocurrency directly influences its market dynamics, particularly its price. Here’s why the SYRUP circulating supply update is important for investors: Impact on Scarcity and Price: If the update implies a slower release of tokens, it could lead to increased scarcity in the short term, potentially supporting price. Conversely, an accelerated release could increase selling pressure. Transparency and Trust: Clear communication about supply schedule changes enhances transparency. Projects that openly communicate such adjustments build greater trust within their community and among investors. Market Capitalization Calculation: Market capitalization (circulating supply x price) is a widely used metric for valuing a cryptocurrency. Any change in circulating supply directly impacts this figure, affecting how the asset is perceived relative to others. Investment Strategy Adjustment: Investors need to reassess their investment thesis. A change in supply schedule might alter the risk-reward profile of holding SYRUP, requiring adjustments to entry or exit strategies. Understanding these implications is vital for making informed decisions. While the immediate impact might not always be drastic, the long-term effects on token distribution and market sentiment can be significant. Aspect of Supply Potential Change Likely Market Impact Vesting Schedule Extended release period for team tokens Reduced selling pressure, increased scarcity Strategic Allocations New tokens for partnerships or ecosystem grants Increased utility, but potentially more tokens in circulation Liquidity Incentives Adjusted rewards for liquidity providers Influences trading volume and depth Token Burn Events Permanent removal of tokens from supply Direct increase in token scarcity, often positive price impact Navigating Tokenomics: Actionable Insights for SYRUP Holders For those holding SYRUP or considering an investment, the Upbit announcement on SYRUP circulating supply should prompt a deeper dive into the token’s fundamentals. Here are some actionable insights: Consult Official Sources: Always refer to Maple Finance’s official website, blog, or whitepaper for the specific details of the updated schedule. Upbit’s announcement serves as a notification, but the project team provides the granular information. Understand the ‘Why’: Investigate the reasons behind the project team’s request for the change. Is it to support new product launches, enhance decentralization, or react to market conditions? The rationale often reveals the project’s strategic direction. Re-evaluate Your Position: Consider how the updated supply schedule aligns with your personal investment goals and risk tolerance. Does it strengthen your conviction in the project’s long-term viability, or does it introduce new concerns? Monitor Market Reaction: Observe how the market reacts to the news. While initial reactions can be speculative, sustained price movements or changes in trading volume can indicate broader sentiment. Stay Updated on Maple Finance Developments: Token supply changes are often part of a larger strategic plan. Keep abreast of Maple Finance’s overall development, partnerships, and community engagement to understand the full context. Being proactive in your research and analysis will help you make more informed decisions in response to such updates. What Does This SYRUP Circulating Supply Change Mean for Maple Finance? The request from Maple Finance to adjust its SYRUP circulating supply schedule highlights the project’s active management of its tokenomics. Maple Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on institutional lending. For such a project, precise control over token distribution is vital for several reasons: Long-Term Stability: A well-managed token supply schedule can contribute to the long-term stability and health of the ecosystem by preventing excessive inflation or sudden token dumps. Alignment with Milestones: Projects often tie token releases to specific development milestones or business achievements. Adjusting the schedule ensures that token distribution remains aligned with the project’s progress and value creation. Attracting Institutional Adoption: For a protocol targeting institutional clients, predictability and sound tokenomics are critical. Any adjustment could be aimed at making SYRUP more attractive to large-scale investors who prioritize stable and transparent token distribution models. Ecosystem Growth: New initiatives, such as grants for developers, liquidity incentives, or community-driven programs, often require specific token allocations that might necessitate a revised schedule. Ultimately, this change reflects Maple Finance’s ongoing efforts to optimize its tokenomics for its evolving strategy and market position. It underscores the importance of flexible yet transparent token management in the fast-paced DeFi landscape. The announcement from Upbit regarding the updated SYRUP circulating supply schedule for Maple Finance is a significant development for the token’s ecosystem. While the specifics of the changes require a deeper dive into Maple Finance’s official communications, the event itself serves as a reminder of the critical role tokenomics play in a cryptocurrency’s value proposition. Investors must remain vigilant, leveraging official announcements from exchanges like Upbit and direct information from project teams to stay ahead. By understanding the ‘why’ behind such changes and their potential implications, you can better navigate the complexities of the crypto market and make more robust investment decisions for your portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is SYRUP circulating supply? The SYRUP circulating supply refers to the number of Maple Finance (SYRUP) tokens that are currently available to the public and actively traded in the market. It is a key metric used to calculate the token’s market capitalization. Why did Upbit update the SYRUP circulating supply schedule? Upbit updated the schedule at the direct request of the Maple Finance project team. Such requests are typically made to align token releases with strategic project developments, market conditions, or new ecosystem initiatives. How does a change in circulating supply affect a token’s price? A change in circulating supply can impact a token’s price by altering its scarcity. If fewer tokens are released, scarcity increases, potentially supporting the price. If more tokens are released, it could lead to increased selling pressure. Where can I find the detailed updated SYRUP circulating supply schedule? For the most detailed and specific information regarding the updated SYRUP circulating supply schedule, investors should refer to the official announcements and documentation provided by the Maple Finance project team on their official website or communication channels. Is this update a positive or negative development for SYRUP holders? The impact depends on the specifics of the update. A slower release schedule might be seen as positive due to increased scarcity, while an accelerated release could be viewed negatively. It’s crucial to understand the rationale behind the change and its alignment with Maple Finance’s long-term vision to assess its overall impact. What is Maple Finance? Maple Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that provides institutional-grade capital markets infrastructure. It enables uncollateralized lending for institutions and offers yield opportunities for lenders in the crypto space. Did you find this article insightful?

2025-08-04 06:10:10,49507439,1754287810,Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment for Traders,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment for Traders In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, understanding market sentiment is paramount. While price charts tell one story, the underlying sentiment of traders often paints a more complete picture. This is where the Bitcoin long short ratio comes into play, offering a vital glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves in the market. For anyone involved in BTC perpetual futures, grasping this ratio is not just helpful; it’s absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. It helps you see beyond the immediate price action and understand the collective bullish or bearish bias of the market participants. What Exactly Are BTC Perpetual Futures? Before diving deep into the Bitcoin long short ratio , it’s essential to understand the instrument itself: BTC perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed expiry date, perpetual futures do not. This unique feature makes them highly popular among cryptocurrency traders because they can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. They are designed to mimic the spot price of Bitcoin, using a mechanism called ‘funding rates’ to keep the perpetual contract price closely tied to the underlying asset’s spot price. This continuous nature allows for constant speculation on Bitcoin’s future price movements, making the aggregated data from these contracts a powerful indicator of market mood. Decoding the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: What Does it Tell Us? The Bitcoin long short ratio is a metric that compares the number of long positions (bets that the price will go up) to the number of short positions (bets that the price will go down) on a particular exchange or across the entire market. It’s typically calculated as the total volume or number of long positions divided by the total volume or number of short positions. A ratio above 1 generally indicates a dominance of long positions, suggesting a bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 points to more short positions, signaling a bearish outlook. This ratio acts as a real-time pulse of trader confidence, showing whether the majority of participants anticipate an upward or downward price movement. It’s a direct reflection of collective market positioning. The Latest Snapshot: BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios (Past 24 Hours) Let’s take a look at the most recent 24-hour data for Bitcoin long short ratio across several major cryptocurrency exchanges. This snapshot provides immediate insight into the prevailing sentiment. Observing these figures can help traders gauge the overall market mood and identify potential divergences or convergences in trader expectations. Category Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Market 49.35% 50.65% As the aggregate data suggests, the overall market currently shows a slight lean towards short positions. With 50.65% of positions being short against 49.35% long, there’s a marginal bearish bias across the board. This indicates that slightly more traders, by volume, are betting on a decline in Bitcoin’s price over the short term. However, the ratio is very close to equilibrium, suggesting a highly contested market without a strong directional conviction from the majority. A Closer Look: Exchange-Specific Bitcoin Long Short Ratio Dynamics While the total market ratio gives a general idea, examining individual exchanges can reveal interesting nuances in the Bitcoin long short ratio . Different exchanges cater to different types of traders, which can lead to varying sentiment profiles. Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Binance 47.96% 52.04% Bybit 50.25% 49.75% Gate.io 52.39% 47.61% Data shows a slight overall short bias in BTC perpetual futures, with variations across exchanges. Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment for Traders Binance: This exchange shows a more pronounced bearish sentiment compared to the overall market, with 52.04% short positions. Given Binance’s large user base, which includes a significant number of retail traders, this could suggest that a substantial portion of the retail segment is anticipating a downward move. This often reflects a quick reaction to recent price dips or general market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Bybit: Bybit presents a nearly balanced picture, with a very slight lean towards long positions at 50.25%. This indicates a more neutral or indecisive sentiment among its user base, suggesting that traders on Bybit are either split on future price direction or are waiting for clearer signals before committing heavily to one side. Such equilibrium can sometimes precede significant moves once a clear catalyst emerges. Gate.io: In contrast to Binance, Gate.io exhibits the strongest bullish sentiment among the top three, with 52.39% long positions. This suggests that traders on Gate.io are more optimistic about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Differences like these highlight that market sentiment isn’t monolithic; it can vary significantly across different trading platforms due to diverse user demographics, trading styles, and liquidity pools. Why is the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio a Vital Indicator for Traders? Understanding the Bitcoin long short ratio offers several strategic advantages for traders. Firstly, it serves as a powerful sentiment gauge. If the ratio is heavily skewed one way, it signals strong conviction among traders. Secondly, it can act as a contrarian indicator. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, it might suggest that the market is over-leveraged on the bullish side, potentially setting up for a short squeeze or a liquidation cascade if the price moves unexpectedly against the majority. Conversely, a heavily short-skewed ratio could indicate an oversold market ripe for a bounce. Lastly, it can be a confirmation tool, validating your own analysis if your directional bias aligns with the majority or divergence if it doesn’t, prompting further investigation. Factors Influencing Bitcoin Long Short Ratio Shifts The Bitcoin long short ratio is dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Primary among these are significant price movements; a sharp drop might trigger more short positions, while a strong rally could encourage longs. News events, whether positive (e.g., institutional adoption, regulatory clarity) or negative (e.g., exchange hacks, regulatory crackdowns), can swiftly shift sentiment. Funding rates on perpetual futures also play a role; high positive funding rates incentivize shorting (as shorts get paid), while negative rates incentivize longing. Macroeconomic data, such as inflation reports or interest rate decisions, can indirectly impact crypto markets and, consequently, trader positioning. Finally, large whale movements or sudden changes in open interest can also signal shifts in major players’ strategies, influencing the overall ratio. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges in Interpreting Bitcoin Long Short Ratio Data While invaluable, the Bitcoin long short ratio is not a standalone crystal ball. One challenge is its inherent volatility; the ratio can change rapidly, reflecting the fast-paced nature of crypto markets. Secondly, it doesn’t account for the size of individual positions; a few large ‘whale’ trades can disproportionately influence the ratio compared to many smaller retail trades. Moreover, it’s a lagging or concurrent indicator, meaning it reflects current sentiment rather than predicting future price action with certainty. Traders must also be aware of potential manipulation or ‘fakeouts,’ where large players might intentionally skew the ratio to induce certain market reactions. Therefore, it should always be used in conjunction with other analytical tools. Actionable Strategies: Leveraging the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio in Your Trading So, how can you effectively use the Bitcoin long short ratio in your trading strategy? Firstly, combine it with technical analysis. Look for divergences: if the price is making new highs but the ratio shows increasing shorts, it might signal weakness. Conversely, if price is dropping but longs are increasing, it could suggest a potential reversal. Secondly, pay attention to extreme readings. An exceptionally high long ratio could be a warning sign of an overbought market, potentially due to over-leveraged positions. Similarly, an extremely low long ratio (high short ratio) might indicate an oversold market. Finally, consider the funding rates alongside the ratio. High positive funding rates combined with a high long ratio might signal an impending correction, as longs are paying shorts heavily, making shorting more attractive. Conclusion: Mastering Market Sentiment with the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio The Bitcoin long short ratio is a powerful tool for discerning market sentiment in the volatile world of BTC perpetual futures. By understanding how traders are collectively positioning themselves, you gain an edge in anticipating potential price movements and managing your risk more effectively. While no single indicator guarantees success, integrating the long-short ratio with a comprehensive analysis of technical indicators, fundamental news, and overall market structure can significantly enhance your trading decisions. Always remember that the crypto market is dynamic, and continuous learning and adaptation are key to navigating its complexities. Empower yourself with data, but always trade responsibly and with a well-defined strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing positions to be held indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. They use a funding rate mechanism to keep their price anchored to Bitcoin’s spot price. How is the Bitcoin long short ratio calculated? The Bitcoin long short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total volume or number of long positions by the total volume or number of short positions on a specific exchange or across multiple exchanges. For example, if there are 60% long positions and 40% short positions, the ratio would be 1.5 (60/40). What does a high or low Bitcoin long short ratio indicate? A high Bitcoin long short ratio (e.g., above 1.0) indicates that there are more long positions than short positions, suggesting a generally bullish sentiment among traders. Conversely, a low ratio (e.g., below 1.0) signifies more short positions, pointing to a prevailing bearish sentiment. Extreme ratios can sometimes signal market tops or bottoms. Is the Bitcoin long short ratio a reliable indicator for trading? The Bitcoin long short ratio is a valuable sentiment indicator but should not be used in isolation. While it provides insight into trader positioning, it can be volatile and influenced by large players. For reliable trading decisions, it’s best combined with other analytical tools like technical analysis, open interest data, funding rates, and fundamental market news. Why do Bitcoin long short ratios differ across exchanges? Ratios can differ across exchanges due to variations in their user demographics, trading volumes, liquidity, and the specific algorithms they use to calculate the ratio. Some exchanges might have a higher proportion of retail traders, while others attract more institutional or professional traders, leading to different collective sentiments on each platform. How can I use the Bitcoin long short ratio in my trading strategy? You can use the Bitcoin long short ratio as a sentiment confirmation tool or a contrarian indicator. If your analysis aligns with the ratio, it confirms your bias. If the ratio is at an extreme (e.g., overwhelmingly long or short) and diverges from price action, it might signal an impending reversal. Always use it as part of a broader strategy, not as the sole decision-making factor. Did you find this analysis of the Bitcoin long short ratio insightful?

2025-08-03 20:06:09,49482570,1754251569,"Experienced Analyst Reveals Options, Bullish and Bearish Price Predictions for Bitcoin Price in the New Week","In his latest report, cryptocurrency analyst Axel Adler evaluated Bitcoin and the general crypto market within the framework of macroeconomic developments, price momentum, and the options market. According to Adler, external risks such as weak employment data and rising trade tariffs have reduced risk appetite in markets, leading to sharp corrections in Bitcoin. According to Adler's analysis, weak nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data released in the US, the Fed's fifth consecutive interest rate cut, and a wave of new tariffs have driven investors to safe havens. Stocks have sold off during this period, and Bitcoin's price has fallen from $119,000 to $112,000. Bitcoin's 30-day momentum has fallen from 8.6% to 3%. Despite increasing short-term market pressure, Adler notes that major companies, particularly Coinbase, Tether, and institutional strategy funds, have made approximately 30,000 BTC worth of new purchases. Coin outflows from exchanges also continue. Related News: Bitcoin Miners' Profit Margin Reaches Highest Level in Recent Times - What Does This Mean? According to Adler, the $119,000 level remains a key resistance level, while the $112,000 level is currently a critical support area. A break above this level could lead to the price testing $110,000, while $108,000 acts as psychological support. A decline in 30-day momentum to 3% indicates a significant weakening of the uptrend, according to Adler. A rebound above 8–10% could indicate buyers are re-entering the market. The Maximum Loss price, which is the level at which the highest loss will occur in the Bitcoin options market, is at $118,000 for the expiration date of August 8, 2025. The sharp decline in option selling volume at levels above $110,000 suggests that bearish positions are weakening, according to Adler. Adler also outlined bull and bear scenarios for the BTC price: Bullish scenario: If the $118,000 level holds and call volume continues to increase, the price could test the $122,500–$125,000 range. A break above this level could bring targets of $130,000 and above to the forefront. Bearish scenario: If the $118,000 level is broken and the put option volume in the $112,500–$115,000 range exceeds $1 million, the price may pull back to the $110,000–$112,500 range. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-03 20:05:33,49482541,1754251533,Analyst: Should We Ignore This XRP Sell Signal?,"Crypto analyst StephisCrypto has shared a weekly chart of XRP paired with the U.S. dollar on Bitstamp, highlighting what the analyst describes as a potentially significant sell signal. The chart features candlestick data extending into mid-2025 and shows that XRP recently climbed to a high above the $3.50 level before a small retracement. Red arrows are marked at prior points of price peaks, suggesting a repeated pattern where these signals coincided with market pullbacks. The chart also shows that the recent upswing in XRP followed a period of sideways price consolidation, culminating in a large green candlestick that propelled the token past the $3 mark. The pattern appears consistent with previous movements where price rallies were accompanied by elevated stochastic relative strength index readings. Should we ignore this #XRP sell signal? pic.twitter.com/qBXPbBGWfo — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 Stochastic RSI Readings and Interpretation In the lower panel of the chart, the stochastic RSI is plotted with two lines colored blue and orange, displaying current readings of approximately 77.65 and 85.77. Historically, each red arrow was placed when the stochastic RSI reached or exceeded similar levels, which often preceded corrective price activity. The analyst appears to be emphasizing that the current stochastic RSI is again in the higher range. While the stochastic RSI can be an indicator of overbought conditions, it is not definitive evidence of an imminent reversal without considering broader market context and price structure. The attached commentary suggests that the analyst is urging caution among traders who rely on technical signals for short-term positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses to the Observation Several users on platform X provided their perspectives on the analysis. An account named X Finance Bull commented , stating that momentum looks stretched but that structural factors are more important to their strategy. This response indicates a preference for prioritizing longer-term support and resistance zones over momentum oscillators alone. Another user, MJS, contributed a perspective suggesting that different investors interpret these signals based on their objectives. MJS noted that if individuals are involved with XRP due to expectations about its role in the future financial system, they should maintain a longer time horizon and not react impulsively to individual technical readings. The statement closed with a remark implying that not all market participants will endure volatility successfully. Considerations for Traders and Investors The chart and commentary illustrate an ongoing debate between technical trading disciplines and broader investment theses. While the stochastic RSI is elevated, suggesting a possible overextension in short-term momentum, other considerations such as overall market structure, adoption trends, and sentiment toward XRP’s long-term utility may influence decisions. The historical examples marked on the chart show that similar stochastic RSI conditions coincided with price pullbacks. However, whether this pattern will repeat depends on factors including liquidity conditions, macroeconomic trends, and developments specific to XRP’s ecosystem. As with any trading decision, participants are encouraged to consider multiple timeframes and to remain aware of the inherent risks in digital asset markets.

2025-08-03 20:00:56,49484988,1754251256,Ethereum vs. Solana: Which Altcoin Will Be the Bull Market Leader?,"Ethereum and Solana are once again drawing headlines as the altcoin market shows renewed signs of life. With Ethereum approaching the $4,000 mark and Solana hovering near $180, investors are comparing the two for leadership in the next bullish leg. But while these giants battle for dominance, another project—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is quietly drawing early-stage attention for those looking beyond the obvious names. Ethereum Shows Strength Into Q3 Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $3,801, up 1.48% in the past 24 hours and 5.42% over the last week. The token’s momentum is being fueled by surging institutional interest, with over $5.4 billion in ETF inflows recorded this month. On-chain data also shows aggressive whale accumulation, with large holders scooping up more than $4 billion in ETH. The rally has been steady, supported by solid fundamentals and a favorable technical setup. RSI indicators remain balanced, showing room for growth without signaling overbought conditions. As a result, Ethereum is once again being positioned as the altcoin market’s pace-setter. Away from the headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own breakout story. The project’s current presale round has eclipsed all previous cycles in demand , with retail and strategic buyers moving in rapidly. Investors are already eyeing amazing returns if the growth curve mirrors early-stage altcoin cycles like SHIBA or PEPE. As major exchange listings loom, access is tightening fast, making early entry more urgent than ever. Solana Faces Pullback After Strong Rally Solana (SOL), now trading at $179.42, is down nearly 6% on the week, even as its long-term chart remains bullish. The RSI reading is slipping below 37, often a sign of oversold conditions, though no strong rebound has formed yet. SOL had previously pushed above $200 but has since retreated as traders rotated profits elsewhere. Despite its drop, Solana maintains a sizable market cap of $96.5 billion, keeping it firmly in the large-cap category. Still, in the current cycle, Solana is showing less resilience compared to Ethereum’s sustained strength. Conclusion In summary, Ethereum appears to be regaining its leadership role thanks to strong ETF inflows and growing institutional demand. Solana, while still relevant, is showing signs of cooling in the short term. But for those seeking explosive potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about presale opportunities this year —mirroring the kind of early interest that preceded some of crypto’s biggest success stories .

2025-08-03 20:00:26,49484078,1754251226,Spartans Changes the Game with Big Bonuses and a Huge Game List While Betano Focuses on Sponsorships,"The sports betting world is growing fast, not just from big-name deals or large events. The real shift is happening where users play. While Betano has become the new title sponsor of Portugal’s Supertaça and works to increase its name across football, Spartans is standing out in another way. It offers 300% welcome bonuses, 5,963 games, and crypto payouts that are processed right away. This platform gives value now, not later. Today’s users want quick access, fair terms, and smooth payouts. They are starting to care less about big names and more about real use. Betano struggles to match that. Traditional sportsbooks like Betano focus on growing through ads and football deals, while Spartans is showing what a modern betting site can really do. There are no KYC forms, no delays with banks, and no lack of games that offer fast fun and easy access. Betano Partners with FPF to Sponsor Portuguese Super Cup The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) has announced that Betano will sponsor the Supertaça Candido de Oliveira in 2024. Betano is an online betting brand owned by Kaizen Gaming. The agreement is already active. It makes Betano the title sponsor of the Super Cup game between Sporting CP and SL Benfica, which takes place on July 31 at Estadio Algarve. Joao Medeiros Cardoso, head of marketing at FPF, said this deal will raise the Supertaça’s profile and help bring Portuguese football to a wider global audience. The deal also includes matchday events and ways for fans to engage more. Ricardo Branquinho, Betano’s country manager in Portugal, said the company wants to grow its sports support and get closer to fans. Betano is also known for backing FC Bayern, the 2025 Copa América Femenina, and the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. These deals show Betano’s push to become a top name in global football. Esports Toto: South Korea’s Plan to Regulate Esports Gambling South Korea may soon launch “Esports Toto,” a betting system backed by the government. Proposed by KeSPA, this system would allow legal betting on top games like League of Legends and Dota 2. The idea is to build on the country’s Sports Toto model. If approved, it could bring money into leagues, improve esports structures, and add to the National Sports Promotion Fund. The idea is gaining support, especially from South Korea’s Democratic Party, which supports tech. Supporters believe it could fight illegal gambling, bring more trust to the market, and give pro esports teams new backing. But not everyone agrees. Some worry about young people getting hooked on gambling too early. Studies show students already face risks from illegal betting, which now controls 80% of gambling in the country. Critics say that if rules are too weak, Esports Toto could make gambling too normal. Still, if this plan works, South Korea could become a leader in legal esports betting. It might shape how other countries in Asia treat esports and gambling in the future. How Spartans Puts Players First with Fast Access and Big Bonuses While sites like Betano focus on branding and sports sponsorships, Spartans.com takes a direct path to the user. It uses only crypto payments, removing delays from banks and skipping slow checks. Winnings are sent right away, and players can withdraw smoothly at any time. Spartans stands out with over 5,963 games, including slots, blackjack, crash games, roulette, baccarat, and live shows. It also offers a full sportsbook that covers EPL, NBA, UFC, and more. With over 43 providers, the platform has options for all types of players and game styles. Spartans focuses on clear terms, fast features, and full access. There are no delays in getting started, no confusing bonus terms, and no limits based on your location. It’s made to work well for crypto users who want easy use and fair play, not just another big brand. Players can log in on any device, anytime. The site is built for mobile use, and no app is required. Every part of the experience is made to be quick, smooth, and ready for action across all crypto methods. Final Say Betano is gaining attention with more sports deals, but its actual site use is not moving fast enough for crypto users. Spartans puts the focus on the things that matter: more games, stronger bonuses, and fast money out. This is not just about which brand is louder. It’s about which one gives more value. Spartans does that with rewards that don’t take time or steps. Whether you are spinning slots, betting live, or playing table games with crypto, everything works right away and without guesswork. So while Betano builds its name through ads and deals, Spartans gives players something more real. In the fast world of crypto betting, that’s what matters. That’s why more serious players are moving to Spartans now.

2025-08-03 20:00:18,49484076,1754251218,"2025’s Top Crypto Performers: BlockDAG’s BTC Auction Gains, Pi Hits 60M, ENA Moves 17.6%","Strong performance often shows under pressure, and three crypto names are now in focus. Pi Network is moving fast, reaching 60 million users, and Ethena is climbing after a key price breakout. Both are moving forward, but BlockDAG stands out for its structured progress. Its 10 BTC Auction is now live, rewarding presale participants ahead of the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With $360 million raised and 24.6 billion BDAG sold, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focused on results, not just attention. For those watching the top crypto performers of 2025, this approach offers a clear edge. BlockDAG Activates Final Auction Phase Before August 11 Launch BlockDAG has entered the final part of its presale with strong momentum. To raise engagement, it has launched a 10 BTC Auction worth more than $1.1 million. This final move is set to drive activity right before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This is not just a regular giveaway. It works by linking every BDAG purchase before the deadline to the auction. The more one buys, the higher the possible share of the Bitcoin pool. This event is the final stage in a larger plan. So far, BlockDAG has raised $360 million, sold 24.6 billion BDAG, and recorded a 2,660% ROI since Batch 1. Batch 29 is now priced at $0.0276, but a short-term $0.0016 price window remains open, giving new users more potential for gain. BlockDAG’s method is simple and focused: reward those who act, grow user support, and finish strong. With the auction ending soon and winners to be revealed on launch day, the timeline is clear and urgent. Those following the top crypto performers of 2025 will see that BlockDAG is focused on real outcomes. This campaign is designed to turn users into part of the project’s future. With the auction active, the final week offers a clear reward path for those ready to join. Pi Network Progress: User Growth Drives New Phase The current Pi Network outlook shows rising momentum as the platform moves past 60 million registered users. This signals strong traction across its ecosystem. Its Open Network is now live, and over 12 million users have completed the migration from mining to active use on the mainnet. This marks a major shift. Users are now moving from collecting to real participation. This rise in verified users is leading to improved ecosystem use. Pi Network outlook now highlights expanding real-world utility through early apps, growing merchant interest, and wallet features. The launch of Pi App Studio also adds to the pace, inviting developers to build inside a decentralized space backed by a wide user base. Even though price clarity is still unfolding, more listings and better liquidity are expected to help define value. What remains clear is the consistent growth in participation and the steady release of supply. Pi Network is turning community support into real forward movement. Ethena ENA Moves Up: Technical Breakout Builds Strength Ethena ENA technical outlook has shifted after a sharp breakout. In the past week, ENA rose about 17.6 percent after breaking above the $0.485 level, which has now turned into solid support. This move brought new buying interest and higher trading activity. New on-chain data shows more than 1.07 billion ENA taken off exchanges. This suggests lower short-term selling pressure and stronger holding behavior. ENA is now above both its 50-day and 200-day EMAs, pointing to steady upward movement. Forecasts now place the next price zone between $0.60 and $0.70. If momentum keeps building, a run toward $1.00 or more is possible. Still, some short-term risks remain, as RSI and MACD indicators show strong momentum that may lead to a pullback before further gains. BlockDAG Marks a Clear Path in the 2025 Crypto Landscape As Pi Network expands user activity and Ethena moves forward with new technical strength, BlockDAG is following a clear and structured plan. Its 10 BTC Auction links buying activity to reward, forming a presale model focused on timing, planning, and results. BlockDAG has raised over $360 million and is preparing for its GLOBAL LAUNCH on August 11. This effort shows more than potential. It shows real movement. For those reviewing the top crypto performers of 2025, BlockDAG’s progress shows how connecting structure with delivery can set a project apart. The current campaign shows what can happen when every action is designed to create outcome. Among the top crypto performers , BlockDAG is showing how strategy, structure, and timing come together to move forward with purpose.

Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.2997 Market Cap $863.39M Trading Volume (24-hour) $98.34M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.3042 24-h Low $0.2808 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 9% 50-Day SMA $ 0.340139 14-Day RSI 34.94 Green Days 15/30 (50%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) 200-Day SMA – Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : SONIC is showing a mild recovery but still stuck below major resistance near $0.34 Indicators across both timeframes suggest weak momentum and indecision Key support lies at $0.27 while resistance remains at $0.31 and $0.34 Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day SONIC/USD chart on Aug 3, the asset is attempting a mild rebound, rising approximately 3.20% to $0.3000 after touching lower Bollinger Band support near $0.2753. However, the broader trend remains bearish, with the price significantly below the 20-day SMA at $0.3439 and the upper band resistance at $0.4124. The RSI remains weak at 39.38, indicating that SONIC is still in oversold territory and lacks strong momentum. The MACD remains negative, showing no crossover, which implies that downward pressure could persist. Unless it breaks decisively above the $0.343 resistance, SONIC risks revisiting its lower support zone around $0.27 or lower. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour SONIC/USD chart, the price has rebounded slightly to $0.30, but it remains beneath the midline of the Bollinger Bands ($0.3088), suggesting limited bullish strength. The MACD is flat with both the signal line and MACD line converging near zero, which reflects market indecision and absence of strong trend momentum. The Balance of Power indicates neutral pressure, meaning buyers and sellers are evenly matched. Until the price breaks above $0.31 convincingly, upside remains capped. The lower Bollinger Band at $0.2778 acts as key support, while resistance lies near $0.3398. Consolidation or minor pullback remains likely short-term.

Based on SONIC’s 1-day and 4-hour charts, the token is showing signs of tentative recovery but remains in a broader bearish structure. On the daily chart, SONIC recently bounced from the lower Bollinger Band and now hovers near $0.30, though it still faces overhead pressure near the $0.3439 mid-band. RSI on the 1-day is weak at 39, indicating limited bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart shows some stabilization but no strong breakout signals, with MACD flat and Balance of Power neutral. Until $0.31–$0.34 is broken with volume, SONIC likely continues in a sideways-to-down trend with resistance overhead and support at $0.27. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5664 price by 2025 and $3.63 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.15 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.63. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.58. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.15 and $3.63, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

2025-08-03 20:00:00,49483362,1754251200,"Higher Bitcoin ETF Options Limits May Cut Volatility, but Boost Spot Demand: NYDIG","Bitcoin’s trademark volatility may be entering a new phase thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency's decision to raise position limits on options for most bitcoin ETFs could help smooth price swings by encouraging strategies like covered call selling, which caps the upside in exchange for steady income, according to NYDIG Research. That increase in position limits for options trading on IBIT came as the regulator approved in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs. By letting traders hold ten times more contracts than before, NYDIG wrote, the SEC has opened the door to more aggressive and sustained options activity. Covered call strategies, in particular, work best at scale. They’re designed to earn yield from existing holdings by selling upside exposure, which can naturally suppress price movement if done across large portfolios. Bitcoin’s volatility has already been on the decline, with Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index ( DVOL ) showing a steady decline from around 90 to 38 over the past four years. Still, it stands out compared to bonds, stocks, and other traditional assets. That makes it a tempting target for investors trying to collect income from market swings, effectively harvesting volatility, but also risky for institutions that require stable exposures. “As volatility declines, the asset becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. This dynamic could reinforce spot demand,” NYDIG’s analysts wrote. Ray Dalio, one of the earliest champions of such risk-parity strategies, recently suggested a 15% allocation to gold and crypto amid rising debt levels. “The feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand,” the firm concluded.

2025-08-03 19:55:49,49482071,1754250949,Canadian Teen Convicted in $37M Bitcoin Heist and 2020 X Hacking Spree,"A Canadian teen has been sentenced for a $37 million Bitcoin (BTC) heist and the hacking of several X accounts. This follows on-chain sleuth ZachXBT’s calls for stricter penalties against SIM swapping and social engineering fraudsters. Suspect’s Sentence ZachXBT revealed via a July 29 X post that Cameron Redman had been convicted and ordered to pay compensation following his involvement in a $37 million Bitcoin theft and a related X hacking case that the investigator had uncovered. Court documents show that Redman has been sentenced to 12 months and 1 day, followed by a three-year supervised release term for each count, with all sentences to be served concurrently. He has also been ordered to pay a $400 special assessment, $248,257.07 in restitution, and a $60,000 fine. On February 22, 2020, the Canadian teenager used a SIM swap attack to take control of crypto investor Josh Jones’s mobile number, allowing him to bypass two-factor authentication and access his wallets. He then stole 1,547 BTC and 60,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), valued at around $37 million at the time. Following the theft, Redman began laundering the stolen assets through hundreds of small transactions. These tokens were eventually funneled through centralized exchanges in an attempt to hide the trail. The perpetrator was later linked to phishing scams and the hacking of several NFT profiles on X. According to ZachXBT, in June 2022, Redman offered access to an internal X panel for sale on the platform SWAPD. This was then sold for 250 ETH and led to the compromise of over 10 accounts and the theft of millions through phishing scams. The detective added that the Canadian youth initially used fake identity documents on SWAPD before submitting his real information, withdrew the sale proceeds through Tornado Cash, and then deposited the funds into a Stake account. On-chain data linked the wallet he used to the compromised X accounts. The investigation identified victims, including Beeple, DeeKay, Zeneca, Nouns DAO, and JRNY Club. Calls for Tougher Rules The suspect was formally charged on November 17, 2021, by Hamilton Police in Ontario. Authorities recovered $5.4 million in crypto, but the remaining $31.5 million is still missing. At the time of his arrest, Redman was still legally underage, which meant his name remained sealed and his photo was not released. ZachXBT has previously highlighted how this kind of secrecy is part of the problem, saying the convicted criminal’s identity should have been revealed earlier on to prevent further unlawful conduct. Such cases are on the rise, with research from Keepnet Labs showing a 1,055% increase in SIM swap incidents in the UK in 2024. Elliptic’s State of Crypto Scams 2025 analysis also highlighted phishing as a key method used by cybercriminals like North Korea’s Lazarus, with attackers increasingly automating campaigns using AI tools. Meanwhile, ZachXBT previously reported that between November and December last year, a single hacker breached over 15 X accounts, stealing more than $500,000.

2025-08-03 19:48:57,49481811,1754250537,XRP flashes major ‘sell signal’ as temporary price buffer is identified,"Although XRP has gained some ground in the last 24 hours in a bid to breach the $3 resistance, the asset’s technical structure is painting a concerning picture for the short term. According to analysis by Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential recently flashed a sell signal on the three-day chart, prompting a notable price pullback below the $3 mark, he noted in an X post on August 3. The warning signal came after XRP reached highs above $3.60, with the bearish cue suggesting that the latest rally could be running out of steam. The 9-count TD Sequential signal, known for predicting trend exhaustion, appeared just as XRP approached a resistance zone between $3.60 and $4. Since then, prices have been sliding steadily, and the token is now approaching a key short-term support level. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, on-chain data shows that past accumulation behavior points to $2.80 as a temporary buffer for XRP, but real support begins below $2.48. To this end, Martinez identified $2.40 as the critical zone to watch. If XRP continues to bleed lower, this level could act as a final line of defense for bulls to regroup. A failure to hold above $2.40 may open the door for deeper losses, possibly revisiting the $2.00 region. XRP URPD price chart.

2025-08-03 19:30:56,49481165,1754249456,Shiba Inu Faces New Competition—Altcoin Investors Shift to This Trending Token,"Altcoin investors are known for their agility—moving capital toward the next breakout before it hits the mainstream. That’s why all eyes are now on the meme coin sector, where legacy players like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are starting to show signs of exhaustion. SHIB, despite its iconic run, has stalled in recent weeks, leaving some holders to explore fresher, lower-cap alternatives. These moves often happen before the crowd notices, and this time, one particular token is drawing that attention. Analysts now predict a potential 27x return from MAGACOIN FINANCE if current adoption patterns hold. Why SHIB Momentum May Be Peaking After peaking in early 2021, SHIB’s community remained one of the strongest in crypto. But in 2025, price action has been relatively flat. As market-wide liquidity picks up, especially in the meme sector, investors are beginning to rotate funds from older assets into tokens that have yet to experience exponential gains . Blockchain data already shows capital migration toward emerging tokens with meme power, tight supply curves, and high virality. For SHIB holders seeking the next wave, the challenge lies in identifying early-stage projects before listings drive prices up . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Giant Before the Roar One such project now gaining momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With politically charged branding, a fast-expanding online community, and explosive early-stage engagement, it’s emerging as a major contender. According to recent projections, a 27x price explosion might be on the table if current trajectory and adoption patterns continue. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE unique is its combination of viral market appeal and early access scarcity. Market researchers now compare its adoption velocity to the early days of SHIB itself – a coin that also saw explosive early growth due to community intensity and narrative pull. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently in a limited-access stage, and as new investors pile in, the window for strategic entry narrows with each passing day. Analysts and early traders are calling this moment one of the final chances to participate before it hits broader exchanges. Conclusion As the meme coin cycle enters a new phase, projects with strong branding and active communities are dominating social charts. While SHIB’s role in the meme ecosystem remains foundational, capital tends to flow toward asymmetrical opportunities. That dynamic shift is now favoring tokens still in their early momentum phase. Meme coin cycles reward timing. SHIB had its moment, but new tokens are attracting both retail attention and analyst optimism. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 27x upside now circulating among researchers and trading desks, many believe it may be the next to explode.

2025-08-03 19:30:10,49481069,1754249410,"Bitcoin Treasury Companies Are ‘Logical’ As Government Severely Devalues $37,000,000,000,000 US Debt: Macro Guru Luke Gromen","Macro guru Luke Gromen says the rise of Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury companies is a logical response to the US government’s continued debasement of the dollar. In a new video update on YouTube, Gromen says investors are currently reacting to a large-scale financial bubble that has been “kicked upstairs” through the stock, banking, and housing markets before finally being pushed into the Treasury market. Gromen notes that the only way for the US government to maintain the bubble – rather than face a default or a severe depression to get its fiscal situation back in order – is to devalue its debt via inflation. Now that such a reality is becoming clear to market participants, Gromen says it makes perfect sense that many corporate entities are creating shareholder value by taking advantage of BTC’s strict supply cap. “In my opinion, it’s critical to remember how we got here. We had an equity bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the banking sector and the housing sector, it created a housing bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the Treasury market by backstopping virtually everything… Now the credit risk is at the Treasury market level, except, Treasuries have no credit risk. The government can always just print the money to make interest payments and avoid default. So there’s no credit risk in Treasuries, only inflation risk. So in my opinion, what we’re seeing in Bitcoin treasury companies in particular is logical, in light of this primrose path we’ve followed over the past 25 years. As more and more people begin to realize the only way out of this is severe devaluation of US debt, of US sovereign debt, of Western sovereign debt. In that case, I would expect credit spreads to remain relatively low, because all else equal, I’d rather own an Apple bond or a Microsoft bond than a US Treasury bond.” At time of writing, the US government’s national debt is about $37 trillion.

2025-08-03 19:21:40,49480777,1754248900,Bitfinex Whale Buys 300 $BTC Per Day During Crypto Market Crash,"The crypto market is on the back foot after Bitcoin retreats below the $113K threshold, losing over 21% in trading volume over the past 24 hours. The community sentiment is also pushing into the bear zone as the Fear and Greed Index retreats to neutral. Despite the looming trend, one Bitfinex whale decided this is the right time to invest and started gobbling up Bitcoins at a rate of 300 per day. Blockstream CEO, Adam Back, is the one who pointed it out , while also reminding the community that the same whale was acquiring $BTC at a rate of 1,000 per day back in February. This type of investment in a crypto market has ‘buy the dip’ written all over it, in preparation of an even bigger bull. The Market Goes Down as Eric Trump Pushes ‘Buy the Dip’ Message Eric Trump joins the ‘buy the dip’ crowd by sending the message loud and clear on X . Eric posted the message just as Bitcoin was sinking to $112,724, displaying his undying confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to bounce back. This was expected, given that Eric Trump’s Bitcoin stake is about to get $367M fatter. This would be the direct result of the merger between American Bitcoin Corp. and Gryphon Digital Mining, which would give Eric Trump access to over 367M shares, each valued at $1. The deal is set to undergo stockholder approval on August 27, 2025, and 10 AM ET. The merger, announced on July 29 , would make Eric Trump one of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto sphere, which would rush in a new era for Bitcoin and, by extension, the entire crypto market. But why is the crypto market backpedalling? The most obvious reason is Trump’s tariff suspension ending on Friday , which puts pressure on the global economic system once more. On the bright side, the trade agreement saw tariffs go down for US’s trading partners, especially for countries like the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the EU. Despite that, the feeling of economic uncertainty and turmoil lingers, which, ultimately, benefits the crypto market. This means that we should expect a crypto resurgence once Bitcoin bounces back, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will become top gainers thanks to their blockchain utility. Why Snorter Token ($SNORT) is Perfect for Opportunistic Investors Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the perfect ecosystem for opportunistic investors thanks to Snorter Bot, the trader’s best sniper friend. Snorter Bot is the ideal solution to manual coin hunting, which is typically ineffective and exposes you to scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot circumvents these problems by: Instituting real-time alerts to protect against suspicious projects Sniping hot tokens in milliseconds after liquidity appears; so, no lost opportunity Operating in its Telegram chat-only, eliminating the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions The Copy Trading perk is also great for replicating proven strategies to increase your chance of success. All these advantages recommend Snorter Token ($SNORT) as the best choice for opportunistic traders who lack the time or know-how to engage with the market actively. With Snorter Token, you just tailor the Aardvark Bot according to your needs, give it the sniper rifle, and set it loose. $SNORT is still in presale now with a cash pool of $2.7M and growing and a token price of $0.1001. So, if you want to join the project, you should do it while $SNORT is still at its presale price. Given the project’s utility and following post-launch mainstream adoption, $SNORT could experience a massive chart boost in 2025. You can buy your $SNORT by going to the presale page today. When Will the Crypto Market Recover? With Bitcoin already back above the $114K threshold and a 24-hour growth rate of 0.55%, it’s safe to say that the market is already pushing back. While it’s too early to say whether this is a small bump or the sign of a sustained climb, one thing is certain: Bitcoin will bounce back. And when it does, we should expect a new ATH, following July’s $123,153.22, which will drag the entire market along for the ride. That’s when utility-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) could also see an investor surge. This isn’t financial advice.

2025-08-03 19:15:42,49480576,1754248542,SharpLink Buys the Dip and Adds $100M-Worth of $ETH to its Treasury as $BEST Stands to Gain,"SharpLink bought the dip and added another $100M-worth of $ETH to its Ethereum treasury. Arkham pointed out that the address that moved the $ETH already bought another $800M previously for SharpLink Gaming, with the latest transaction of $108.6M going to Galaxy Digital OTC. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve places SharpLink Gaming second on the list of companies with the largest $ETH reserves, with 438.2K tokens. Bitmine Immersion Tech occupies the first spot with 625K $ETH, while the third place belongs to The Ether Machine with 334.8K coins. According to the same data, 2.26% of the total $ETH supply is spread out between 63 strategic reserves, amounting to 2.73M coins with a value of $9.39B. Institutional Interest for $ETH is Going Up as Bitmine’s Tom Lee Predicts a $60,000 $ETH The data shows that public institutions show an increased interest in Ethereum, with some entities exhibiting aggressive buying strategies. The Ether Machine is one such case, after adding 15,000 $ETH to their treasury recently at an average price of $3,809.97 for a total investment of $56.9M. Moreover, the company also announced that they plan an additional $407M investment , which, if it goes through, would more than double Bitmine’s current $ETH reserves of 625K. As the company put it in their X post, this investment strategy isn’t about profit hunting: ‘We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term – not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.’ Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, also pointed out that Ethereum ETFs are experiencing a price surge , with massive inflows hitting the market. Ethereum’s ETF inflows are currently outperforming Bitcoin, up 13% to Bitcoin’s 8% loss over the past two months. This pro-ETH context, with Wall Street becoming increasingly more interested in the asset, drove Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine, to put $ETH’s Estimated Value Potential (EVP) at $60,000+ . He also thinks that the ETH/BTC ratio is off right now and that it’s likely to match 2024’s numbers soon, which would force $ETH up to $5,707 in the near future. With $ETH booming in charts and a bull run waiting to happen, ERC-20 projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) are likely to catch steam first. How $BEST Fuels One of the Best Non-Custodial Wallet Ecosystems $BEST is the official token of the Best Wallet ecosystem, a non-custodial, KYC-free service that’s perfect for novice and experienced traders alike. Best Wallet’s non-custodial profile translates to higher security, as you control the private key and, thus, the funds. The wallet also offers access to a variety of features, including the Token Launchpad, which grants exclusive access to upcoming tokens, allowing you to invest early. The Market Insights feature is another useful addition, feeding you real-time updates on hot projects, market sentiment, and chart trends. This allows you to make more informed decisions before investing. $BEST is currently in presale with over $14.4M already in the bank. This makes $BEST one of the most successful presales of 2025 and one that sets Best Wallet on the road to success. Based on Best Wallet’s features, public appeal, top security, and the fact that it’s free to use, we expect $BEST to experience a chart boom post launch. $BEST’s growth will further feed the Best Wallet ecosystem, pushing it closer to its underlying goal: to capture over 40% of the crypto wallet market share by 2026 . You can buy $BEST at its presale price of $0.025425 by visiting the official presale page. Will We See Another $ETH ATH in 2025? Given the rising investor interest in $ETH, we may see another Ethereum rally soon, pushing the asset to the psychological threshold of $4,000. We may not get Tom Lee’s $60K Ethereum in 2025, but a goal of $5,700 isn’t impossible, once $ETH clears the $4,000 resistance point. When that happens, projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) will be among the first to see the benefits. This isn’t financial advice.

According to the company's data, the price of BTC fell by 4% in a short period of time, from $118,920 to below $114,000. This move occurred immediately after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs. During the drop, over $195 million worth of long positions in futures were liquidated. At the same time, a total of 21,400 BTC belonging to short-term investors were transferred to exchanges at a loss. CryptoQuant noted that this behavior has been observed in similar price drops before. For example: July 15, 2025: 50,134 BTC moved to exchanges July 25, 2025: 39,105 BTC sent to exchanges Related News: A New Claim About Satoshi Nakamoto's Identity Has Been Made: Could It Be That He Has Been Right in Front of Us All Along? This move has brought Bitcoin to the edge of a critical on-chain support cluster, according to the firm's analysis. CryptoQuant noted that this level is defined as a “gap” below which there is weak liquidity and weak support. According to the analysis firm, the critical areas to watch for the BTC price are as follows: Onchain support: $111,600 Technical support (previous ATH): $112,000 Traders' Realized Price: $105,500 *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-03 19:05:00,49480184,1754247900,Bitcoin Crashes Below $115K as Trump Sparks Nuclear Tensions and Fed Turmoil,"Bitcoin plummeted to $113,164 on Friday, losing nearly 8% within hours and triggering over $200 million in liquidations. The downturn coincides with former President Donald Trump’s aggressive political maneuvering and amid rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia. The market’s dramatic downturn reflects growing investor anxiety as Trump reenters the political landscape with incendiary foreign policy statements and attacks on U.S. economic institutions. Trump Orders Sub Repositioning Amid Russia Standoff Trump’s latest posts on Truth Social revealed a major military action: he ordered two nuclear submarines to reposition amid threats from Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. Medvedev had dismissed Trump’s demand to stop the war in Ukraine within ten days as a “step towards war.” Trump responded, stating that there were now “unintended consequences” with military assets being moved. Markets quickly reacted to the escalation, with Bitcoin leading the retreat. Risk assets faltered as the prospect of renewed nuclear tension rattled global investors. Trump Blasts Fed and Jobs Figures Ahead of Election In a separate series of posts, Trump accused Labor Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of fudging job numbers to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’s chances in the 2024 election. He demanded that she be fired and referred to the numbers as “fake.”. Trump also criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him “a stubborn MORON” and demanding now rate cuts. He urged the Federal Reserve Board to work around Powell’s control, an unprecedented suggestion that breaks with decades of central bank independence. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler Resigns, Opening Trump Path Amidst growing political pressure, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler resigned Friday. Though she gave no definite reason, Kugler’s early departure leaves a key vacancy at the central bank—one Trump would be in a position to fill. Kugler, a Biden appointee and vocal supporter of rate stability, had sat out this week’s policy vote. Her resignation adds to the uncertainty at a time when institutional credibility is under assault from the top offices. Bitcoin in the Crosshairs of Political and Market Uncertainty Bitcoin’s steep drop reflects the market’s flight from risk amid global uncertainty. It now trades 7% beneath its all-time high of $123,182, which was reached a few weeks ago. Analysts point to tightening futures premiums and decreased leveraged activity as signs of momentum that is fading. Against expectations that Bitcoin would serve as a haven during political conflict, the asset has instead followed tech stocks, contradicting the safe-haven narrative. Investors are now shifting to short-term bonds and cash positions. Gold has also held firm at around $3,350, but even it has not been able to offer much comfort. Dalio Reassesses Bitcoin Amid U.S. Debt Fears Amidst the turmoil, some long-term investors are giving Bitcoin’s prospects a second thought. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, now recommends allocating as much as 15% of portfolios to Bitcoin or gold as a hedge against inflation and debt. “The U.S. is beginning a debt doom loop,” Dalio warned, referring to a $12 trillion Treasury forecast. While cautious about Bitcoin’s volatility, he acknowledged its evolving character as a store-of-value asset. Conclusion Bitcoin’s fall below $115,000 is more than a matter of price volatility—it is an indicator of a broader investor flight driven by political uncertainty and economic doubt.

Some accounts are spreading rumors that China has banned cryptocurrencies again, without any evidence. These claims lack any official statement or legal text. They rely solely on hearsay. According to Bitcoin Junkies, China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China imposed its last major restrictions in September 2021, targeting mining and exchange activities. That policy remains unchanged. No fresh edicts or directives have emerged from Beijing in 2025. WARNING: False reports are circulating claiming that China has issued a new ban on cryptocurrency. China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China banned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies back in 2021, and that policy remains unchanged. pic.twitter.com/6jiasBWEea — Bitcoin Junkies (@BTCjunkies) August 3, 2025 Bitcoin trades at $114,071 USD, with a live market cap of $2.27 trillion. It sees $53.98 billion in 24-hour volume and holds the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. This positions Bitcoin as the leading digital asset, far ahead of competitors in liquidity and adoption. The four key facts you need to know: Hong Kong as a pilot zone embraces crypto. Hong Kong has launched initiatives to attract exchanges and token issuers. Its regulators have rolled out a licensing regime for spot trading platforms. China never banned individual crypto transactions. Private peer-to-peer transfers remain legal. Only institutional participants, banks, payment firms, and funds are prohibited from offering crypto services. Bitcoin mining still occurs in China. Many miners displaced in 2021 shifted abroad, but some resumed operations in regions with looser enforcement. Estimates suggest China still accounts for around 15% of global hash rate. Stablecoins and RWAs gain traction among officials. Chinese authorities explore tokenized real-world assets and regulated stablecoins for on-chain use cases. Pilot programs in Guangdong and Shanghai test asset-backed instruments. What Beijing’s 2021 Ban Covered Exchange closures. All domestic crypto trading platforms were ordered to cease operations. Mining shut-down. Major mining provinces rescinded power allocations for crypto-heavy users. Financial institutions barred. Banks and payment providers were forbidden from clearing crypto transactions. That framework persists today. No new clauses have been introduced. No new fines have been announced. Hong Kong SAR operates under a separate legal system. It launched its new crypto licensing regime in June 2024. The Securities and Futures Commission now issues licenses to spot exchanges and custodians. This makes Hong Kong one of Asia’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Its pilot zone model aims to draw talent, capital, and blockchain projects away from Silicon Valley and Dubai. On-chain Reality Shows China’s Strong Belief Despite official bans, Chinese nationals still hold and transact crypto. Peer-to-peer OTC desks thrive on messaging apps. VPN-enabled access to foreign exchanges remains common. On-chain data shows persistent activity. Bitcoin’s on-chain transfer volume averages over $20 billion daily, with a sizeable share originating from IPs linked to China. Further Considerations China continues to explore digital currency with its central bank digital currency (e-CNY). That project does not equate to an outright ban on all private crypto. Instead, it reflects a desire to maintain monetary sovereignty and clamp down on illicit finance. As regulators study tokenized stocks, bonds, and commodities, China may issue further guidelines on real-world assets (RWAs) and stablecoins. These moves will shape the next phase of blockchain adoption on the mainland. In sum, the rumor of a fresh China crypto ban is just that, a rumor. China’s 2021 restrictions remain in force. No new prohibitions have been introduced. Meanwhile, Hong Kong forges ahead with open-market policies, and private transactions continue on Chinese-controlled networks. The crypto community can rest easy: nothing new has changed in Beijing’s rulebook. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-08-03 19:03:40,49480076,1754247820,First-Ever Chinese Digital Bond Minted on XRP Ledger,"Guotai Junan International Holdings Limited (GTJAI) has issued the first publicly offered digital bond by a Chinese securities firm, a development that reflects the evolving landscape of capital markets in Asia. The bond, denominated in U.S. dollars with a size capped at $300 million and a three-year maturity, is the first digitally native bond from a Chinese brokerage to be offered to the public. The offering was carried out through HSBC Orion, a distributed ledger-based digital assets platform, with GTJAI serving as both lead joint coordinator and issuer. @MichaelLINY, a crypto educator on X, revealed that the digital bond was minted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The digital bond uses blockchain infrastructure to enhance transparency, streamline issuance, and reduce settlement inefficiencies common in traditional finance. The company says this move aligns with its broader push for innovation in financial services, particularly through technologies that support programmable and secure instruments. GTJAI stated that it will use this issuance as an opportunity to explore cross-border digital asset issuance and other innovative finance applications. First ever Chinese Digital Bond minted on the #XRP Ledger GTJAI Successfully Issued the First Publicly Offered Digital Bond of a Chinese Securities Firm ..This transaction demonstrates the capabilities of HSBC Orion to enable both a broader range of digital bonds and issuers.… pic.twitter.com/EbuKp7jUcz — The light shines in the darkness (@MatthewLINY) August 2, 2025 Signs of XRP’s Growing Infrastructure Role HSBC Orion has developed capabilities that can integrate with various DLT environments, including those supported by Ripple’s institutional-grade custody partner, Metaco. Notably, HSBC and Ripple-owned Metaco entered into a partnership in late 2023 to launch tokenized securities custody solutions, a move that firmly aligns the bank with Ripple’s blockchain ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The XRPL is recognized for its efficiency in settling tokenized assets and other fixed-income products, such as bonds and treasury bills . Although it was not directly referenced in the GTJAI deal, its technological compatibility and Ripple’s growing institutional presence are increasingly relevant as firms like HSBC expand custody and issuance infrastructure for digital bonds. The involvement of Ripple-linked entities in key layers of infrastructure hints at the possibility of XRP or XRPL-related rails used in future capital market deployments, especially as the tokenization market grows . Institutional Leaders Embrace Blockchain Technology Zhang Xueming, GTJAI’s Chief Financial Officer, described the issuance as both a proof of technological leadership and a demonstration of the firm’s commitment to next-generation financial services. HSBC’s John O’Neill, who leads the bank’s digital assets division, commented that the partnership allows HSBC Orion to support “a broader range of digital bonds and issuers.” With the bank already embedding custody infrastructure through Ripple’s Metaco, HSBC’s role in bridging traditional finance and tokenized instruments continues to deepen.

2025-08-03 19:00:55,49480085,1754247655,Best Way to Make Money With Crypto,"In the world of crypto, one principle remains undefeated: timing. Not just buying low and selling high, but entering before the wave begins. From Bitcoin’s earliest days at under $1 to Ethereum’s quiet beginnings at $0.30, the biggest winners were not those with the most capital—but those with the most foresight. Fast forward to 2025, and the opportunity hasn’t disappeared. If anything, it’s evolved. Now, smart investors are hunting for tokens that offer asymmetric upside—projects with strong narratives, emerging communities, and clear signals of momentum before mainstream exposure kicks in. This approach is what turns $500 into $50,000, and helps level the playing field between retail traders and institutions. Today’s profit strategies go beyond holding Bitcoin or earning yield through DeFi. While those approaches offer stability, the fastest gains still come from early entry into under-the-radar altcoins —especially those with viral branding, limited access windows, and traction that mirrors early crypto giants. But identifying the right project requires more than hype. With tools like on-chain analysis, Telegram activity trackers, and social volume aggregators, today’s investor has sharper insight than ever before into what’s building beneath the surface. Why Early-Stage Tokens Still Offer the Best ROI Most projects don’t go 100x. But those that do usually share a few common traits—and they all rewarded those who recognized the patterns early. In recent months, one particular token has been making waves for just that reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention across platforms like X and Telegram not simply for its meme appeal, but for the velocity of its adoption. Crypto research groups tracking social metrics say its early trajectory mirrors the rise of Ethereum Classic, two tokens that generated major returns for initial adopters. But unlike older assets that are now deep into their market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth curve . The project’s viral branding, combined with a limited-access phase, has created a rush among early participants. Every round has seen rapid sellouts, and the project’s social growth has already rivaled meme giants like Dogecoin in their infancy. Analysts now forecast that its current pricing window may be one of the last remaining chances for sharp asymmetric entry before broader exchange access resets the opportunity. How to Spot High-Upside Tokens Before the Crowd Spotting altcoins before they explode isn’t about luck—it’s about pattern recognition. Historically, the biggest crypto winners showed early signs long before their names hit mainstream headlines. These included subtle metrics like surging social media growth, increasing wallet holders, and high engagement rates on social channels like X and Telegram . They also tended to feature emotionally resonant branding, whether political, cultural, or comedic—something that hooks communities and sustains hype across weeks or months. Another key factor? Scarcity of access. The earliest-stage tokens that go on to make 10x–100x moves are often available only for a limited time through exclusive, time-sensitive windows. Once listed on major exchanges, these assets usually price in their potential, leaving little room for exponential gains . The most strategic investors understand this—they track momentum, measure community velocity, and look for entry points when the crowd is still on the sidelines. Final Thoughts: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Act Early The best way to make money in crypto has always been clear— get in before everyone else realizes what’s happening . Whether it’s through identifying social trends, spotting wallet inflows, or analyzing price structure before breakout, timing and conviction are the real tools of the trade. In today’s cycle, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum precisely because they offer that rare mix: powerful community traction, viral positioning, and limited access. And as history has shown, when these elements align, the results can be game-changing .

2025-08-03 19:00:23,49480469,1754247623,Ireland’s central bank chief says October annual budget might harm the economy,"The Irish central bank’s governor, Gabriel Makhlouf, has raised concerns about the government’s focus on enhancing the economy in its October annual budget. Makhlouf warns that the country could be in a bad situation if the government pushes its agenda to boost spending excessively. This statement comes two weeks after the government’s October annual budget proposals were released. The plans comprised a 6.4% increase in spending that everyone needed to adhere to. Meanwhile, this increase in spending, according to analysis from sources, is lower compared to the past budgets set, which ranged between 8% to 9%. Makhlouf raises concerns over the government’s recently released budget plan During an interview, Makhlouf explained that additional stimulus in the sector is unnecessary when an economy is fully employed . Therefore, based on his argument, the government should reconsider its budget plan. The Irish central bank’s governor also pointed out that the country’s economy was in a bad state, urging that the government’s plan could further worsen the situation. On the other hand, in an earlier announcement, the government had mentioned making changes in tax cuts and spending. Following these changes, the agency vowed to reduce the suggested 9.4 billion euro tax cuts and higher expenditure in 2026, if Trump increases the tariff rates above the 10% currently set. Coincidentally, after the agency made public its budget plans in the Summer Economic Statement, the US struck a trade deal with the EU, which resulted in a 15% import tariff on goods from the EU. Concerning the budget plan in the Summer Economic Statement, Makhlouf expressed that he hoped the government would consider changing this plan and make a final one. He concluded, “By then, the government will have thought again about what the trade situation is showing us.” Ireland’s infrastructure lags behind compared to its economic rivals Last month, Prime Minister Micheal Martin announced plans to raise Ireland’s spending on infrastructure by 30%. This increment in spending came after Apple made a €14 billion, or $16 billion , tax payment to the country. Apart from the tax payment, funds raised from selling bank shares also contributed to this significant change. This followed warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Ireland had fallen behind its economic rivals in terms of infrastructure. The report also reported that the country has not utilized tax revenue from the multinationals for years to improve its ailing energy sector, water systems, and housing supply. To address these challenges, the agency has revealed that it intends to shift its focus towards enhancing the energy sector with significant capital investment plans and diversifying energy sources, improving its infrastructure, starting with public transport like roads, and boosting water services in the country to improve housing availability. However, to successfully improve housing availability, Ireland’s national water utility stated that it would require significant funds to supply water services adequately. With its revenue challenges, the government finds it hard to achieve these goals, especially improving housing availability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-08-03 19:00:06,49479933,1754247606,"Live Games, 300% Bonus, & Instant Withdrawals: Here’s How Spartans Beats DraftKings and Betsson in 2025","Bonus offers, marketing campaigns, and strategic expansions fill the betting space, but not every platform excels where it truly matters: clarity, ease of use, and fairness. Betsson has just made a move into Brazil, building a customized platform aligned with local rules. DraftKings continues to grow in the U.S. with stronger live betting features and new lottery integrations. While these efforts push both forward, crypto-first users still face gaps in speed, transparency, and global access. That’s where Spartans steps ahead. It offers 5,963 games, a 300% welcome bonus with clearly outlined terms, and fast crypto withdrawals. With sportsbook access across top leagues, it brings unmatched convenience and value. DraftKings: Advanced Tech, Traditional Limits DraftKings holds strong brand recognition in digital sports betting. Its public NASDAQ listing and recent analyst projections, like Bernstein’s $46 price target, reflect confidence in its growth, largely due to its in-game betting systems. The acquisition of SimpleBet boosted its pricing tech, making real-time bets more accurate and widespread. It also added Jackpocket to expand into digital lottery, allowing cross-promotion between sports betting and lottery players. Users can choose from slots, blackjack, roulette, sportsbook access, and fantasy sports. Yet, some drawbacks remain. DraftKings is mainly built for fiat users, with slow withdrawals and restricted access based on region. Bonus offers differ by location and are often buried in fine print. For those seeking faster crypto use and global flexibility, DraftKings may fall short of being the best pick. Betsson: Building Trust in Regional Markets Betsson is focusing on regulated growth in emerging areas. Its Brazil launch, through a local partnership, adds to its presence in Colombia and Argentina. The company’s approach prioritizes legal compliance and tailored platforms offering sports betting, casino games, and virtual sports. Betsson also launched a responsible gambling campaign in Brazil, supporting safer play with education and awareness tools. This effort has earned praise from industry watchers as a responsible way to grow in new markets. Still, crypto-friendly users may find the platform lacking. Withdrawal speeds are slower, bonuses lack transparency upfront, and there’s limited public access to fairness metrics like RTP. While Betsson continues to grow in localized spaces, it doesn’t yet fully meet the expectations of speed or crypto accessibility. Spartans: Fast Crypto, Clear Bonuses, and 5,963 Games That Work Smoothly Spartans wasn’t made to follow outdated designs; it was built to fix their weak points. That’s why crypto users are turning to it. With 5,963 casino titles, an all-in-one sportsbook from soccer to MMA, and instant crypto payout systems, Spartans delivers on clarity, speed, and utility. The 300% welcome bonus comes with upfront rules, users know the 35x playthrough, 7-day window, and max cashout before depositing. These terms remain stable across all regions, which is a rare advantage over DraftKings and Betsson. What also makes a difference is how quickly users get their funds. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT, withdrawals are handled instantly. Game fairness is backed by published RTP and provably fair systems. Whether playing roulette, blackjack, or live bets, the performance remains smooth. Spartans also stands out with features others skip: mobile access with no need for an app, a fully disclosed affiliate setup (CPA, Rev Share, Hybrid), and a Lamborghini prize draw for top members. For those evaluating the best betting sites based on features that matter, Spartans delivers results where others still fall behind. Final Thoughts DraftKings is leaning into live betting and lottery tools. Betsson is growing with a regulation-focused model in Latin America. But both still leave major gaps, especially for those who want fast cashouts, upfront bonuses, and global crypto options. Spartans answers those needs directly. With over 5,900 games, worldwide sportsbook access, and bonus terms that are clearly stated, Spartans shows that the best betting site isn’t defined by name recognition, it’s about delivery. With instant crypto withdrawals and fair play built in, Spartans isn’t just a challenger, it’s a better choice.

2025-08-03 19:00:06,49481521,1754247606,"Bloomberg Analyst Says Crypto Is Falling Behind, Despite Bitcoin Strength","Mike McGlone, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, has recently shared a warning about the future of cryptocurrencies. He says that while Bitcoin (BTC) is still doing well, the rest of the crypto market is not keeping up with other big assets like stocks, gold, and government bonds. He said that Bitcoin and the U.S. Treasury bonds could become two of the best-performing investments this year, especially during tough economic times. Crypto Returns Match Stocks But With Higher Risk McGlone pointed to lower investor demand and high interest rates as reasons why many digital coins are under pressure . So far in 2025, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) has gained 7%. This matches the year-to-date return of the S&P 500, the main stock market index in the United States. However, McGlone warns that this comparison is misleading. Although he acknowledged that the crypto market is maturing, high volatility makes it more risky. According to McGlone, crypto gives the same return as the S&P 500 but with four times the volatility. He highlighted that investors are taking on much more risk for the same level of profit. At the same time, the Bloomberg Dollar Index has fallen by 7.5% this year. A weaker dollar usually helps push up asset prices, including crypto. Even with this drop, most cryptocurrencies are still not doing well. This adds to McGlone’s argument that the market is not as strong as it appears. Bitcoin May Still Lead, But the Rest May Struggle While McGlone sees problems in the wider crypto market, he still expects the flagship crypto to do well. In his view, Bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bonds are the most likely to perform well this year. This may seem like a contradiction, but McGlone sees long-term value in Bitcoin, calling it a digital form of gold because of its limited supply and adoption rate. However, he also warns that Bitcoin’s success may depend on how the stock market behaves. Furthermore, McGlone also predicts that the stock market will fall sharply. His warning followed a 1.6% fall in the S&P 500 last Friday. This drop caused weaker-than-expected jobs data, which raised concerns about the strength of the economy. Bitcoin Drops After July High In July 2025, Bitcoin hit a record high of $122,838, but since then, its price has dropped to about $112,113. Other cryptocurrencies have fallen even more. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $113,789, up 0.93% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analyst Mike McGlone once said Bitcoin could fall as low as $10,000. Although this has not happened yet, he still stands by his warning. Even though some people disagree with him , McGlone still believes the crypto market could see a big drop.

In the companies’ latest earnings calls, executives from Visa and Mastercard – which handle $13.2 trillion and $8 trillion in payments globally per year, respectively – signaled that the giants were ready to embrace rather than fight stablecoins. Says Visa CEO Ryan McInerney, “…Stablecoins could enable us to have faster cross-border transactions. By the way, that’s true for consumers or for businesses. And we’ve been testing that out and having some good results. We’ve been testing a series of corridors and putting stablecoins to work directly versus the fiat currency money movement options that we’re able to deliver to our clients and their users today… I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that there is real product market fit for stablecoins in remittances for certain corridors. And as the largest money movement platform around the world, we’re going to be an early adopter of a lot of those things on behalf of our clients and their end users.” And in Mastercard’s Q2 earnings call , CEO Michael Miebach also suggested that stablecoins weren’t so much of a threat to the company, but an asset to augment its services. “And as to stablecoins, we see this as another currency. We also see it as additive to the network with opportunities for us to provide the on and off ramps from fiat to stablecoin to partner with [ advice ] and wallets to bring interoperability, bring relevant services, bring global reach and trust to the specific use cases.

The Satoshi Nakamoto statue in Parco Ciani has vanished. Satoshigallery , the group behind the global statue initiative, confirms the theft. The work stood proud since October 25, 2024, debuting at the Plan ₿ Forum, a joint push by the city and Tether to boost crypto adoption. Where is Satoshi? We are offering 0.1 btc to whoever will help us recovering the Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto that was stolen yesterday in Lugano. You can steal our symbol but you will never be able to steal our souls. Thank you all for the nice messages. We are all in this… https://t.co/cAGCqg4CuP pic.twitter.com/iGrBOdVYhe — Satoshigallery (@satoshigallery) August 3, 2025 Last night, someone stole and smashed the bronze likeness. Early reports say the vandal left broken pieces behind, and hours later locals spotted fragments floating in the lake. Police cordoned off the scene and launched a thorough probe,no suspects have been named. Satoshigallery offered a 0.1 BTC reward (≈ $11,900) for tips leading to its recovery, stating, “You can steal our symbol, but you will never be able to steal our souls.” At today’s price of $118,995 per BTC, that bounty stands firm. Not everyone agreed it was a calculated theft. X user @Grittoshi claimed that during Swiss National Day on August 1, intoxicated revelers near the Aur Café simply overturned the statue,welded by just two points,into Lake Lugano as a prank, insisting “cameras are everywhere” and “no way they could cart it off.” Fragments lay scattered, a sad symbol of celebratory excess. Story Update On Satoshi Nakamoto Statue Municipal divers and recovery teams have now retrieved the statue,broken but intact,from Lake Lugano. Satoshigallery publicly thanked the city of Lugano for their swift action, confirming the sculpture is back in their care for restoration. We want to thank the Municipality of Lugano @luganomycity for helping us to recover the statue that was thrown into the lake. https://t.co/UyKhyBvt1m pic.twitter.com/qaHFWXIHRs — Satoshigallery (@satoshigallery) August 3, 2025 Local businesses report that tourist foot traffic dipped since the incident; city officials have pledged support for restoration and will tighten security at Parco Ciani and future crypto-themed exhibitions. Meanwhile, Satoshigallery remains undeterred: plans to cast and install Satoshi statues in 21 cities worldwide are still on track. This episode proves a cautionary tale: public crypto art can galvanize communities but also requires robust protection. Through broken bronze, ripples in the lake, and now a successful recovery, the Satoshi saga continues,an emblem of blockchain’s resilience and the enduring spirit of its community.

2025-08-03 18:38:56,49479113,1754246336,Ripple Price Analysis: These Are XRP’s Next Defense Lines After a Breakdown Below $3,"Ripple’s price is experiencing a pullback after an impulsive rally that began in June. As both the USDT and BTC pairs are now showing signs of bearish momentum, investors are cautiously looking to see if the available support levels can hold and prevent a full-on reversal. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the XRP/USDT pair, Ripple’s token has been rising since early July, before sweeping the liquidity above the $3.40 high and reversing to the downside. The market is currently pulling back toward both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are located near the $2.50 mark, and have just created a bullish crossover. As things stand, the $3.00 level is lost, and if a quick recovery back above this level does not occur, the mentioned moving averages will be the next targets. While the convergence of these moving averages creates a potentially strong support, if it gets broken to the downside, a much deeper drop toward the $1.60 area would be probable. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair is going through a similar pullback, following a swift rejection from the 3,200 SAT resistance zone. The price is currently testing the 200-day moving average and the higher boundary of the broken descending channel around the 2,500 SAT mark. The RSI has also dropped from deeply overbought levels to just below 50, showing a clear shift in momentum. If the 2,500 SAT support zone gets broken to the downside, the price will drop back into the channel, and would likely pull toward the 2,000 SAT area. This scenario would potentially result in a lengthy consolidation and reset the current bullish trend.

2025-08-03 18:35:59,49478972,1754246159,Bitcoin Price Analysis: $100K Breakdown Looms for BTC if This Support Fails,"Bitcoin came under notable selling pressure following heightened geopolitical concerns stemming from the escalating conflict between Russia and the United States over nuclear threats. Despite the bearish momentum, the cryptocurrency has now reached a key support zone, expected to hold in the short term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After a prolonged consolidation within the $116K–$123K range, BTC encountered heavy selling pressure, driven by escalating concerns over the Russia–US nuclear conflict. This led to a breakdown below the critical $114K support, sparking fear and uncertainty in the market. However, BTC has now approached a major support zone between $111K and $112K, an area defined by the lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel and a key previous swing high. This confluence of technical support is likely to attract patient buyers, potentially initiating a bullish consolidation phase. Still, if the price fails to hold above this region, a rapid decline toward the psychological $100K level could follow. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s breakdown from the bullish flag pattern marks a bearish technical signal, confirming the pattern’s failure. The sharp rejection from the flag’s upper boundary triggered a steep decline, bringing the price to a critical support near the $112K zone, which also aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This particular one often acts as a magnet for short-term bullish reactions. As long as the price holds above this range, a corrective bounce is likely. However, if bearish momentum persists, another sell-off targeting a sweep below $111K–$112K may occur. Until then, short-term consolidation remains the most probable outcome. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Exchange Netflow indicator shows that 16,417 BTC flowed into exchanges yesterday, the highest daily net inflow since mid-July. This suggests a significant number of holders are moving their Bitcoin to exchanges, typically a precursor to selling activity. At the same time, the Exchange Whale Ratio surged above 0.70, indicating that the majority of these deposits came from large holders (whales). Historically, when whale-dominated inflows coincide with elevated exchange activity, the market often faces increased selling pressure and price declines. If this trend continues and whales persist in depositing BTC at this pace, further downside risk could follow. Such activity may reflect profit-taking, preparation for a correction, or strategic reallocation in anticipation of near-term volatility.

2025-08-03 18:30:55,49478831,1754245855,Slow And Steady: Bitcoin’s Current Rise Feels Different—Study,"Bitcoin’s recent climb has been calm and measured, a sharp contrast to the explosive rallies of the past. It’s trading above its historical growth path, but far from overheating. Long-time holders remain mostly inactive, while the bulk of trading activity is coming from fresh faces in the market. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Bitcoin Growth Remains On Track Based on reports by Arab Chain using CryptoQuant data, Bitcoin’s price is tracking a Power Law trend that suggests a smooth, logarithmic rise over time. That model creates a curved path rather than sudden spikes. Right now, BTC sits above the expected growth line but well below the upper “red zone” that signals overheating. The divergence indicator is positive, yet far from levels seen in past bubbles. This pattern hints at natural growth or perhaps the early stages of renewed betting. Divergence Keeps Room For Upside Analysts note that staying below the top watch zone leaves room for more gains before panic sets in. In prior cycles, prices shot through that red zone and then collapsed. Today, Bitcoin is about $50,000 under its most recent peak level. That gap suggests buyers still have breathing room if they choose to push prices higher. On-chain data from Glassnode shows short-term holders (STHs) are behind most of the action. Around 86% of Bitcoin’s spent volume over the last 24 hours came from wallets active less than 155 days, totaling $18 billion. Long-term holders (LTHs) accounted for only 14.5% of spent volume, or $3.10 billion. That split means newer entrants are driving swings, while veteran holders stay largely on the sidelines. Long-Term Holders Show Conviction That dichotomy between STHs and LTHs tends to indicate intense conviction among core believers. When long-term owners remain in place, price drops tend to be more subtle. Buyers who have hung on for years or months typically view dips as opportunity to add rather than times to sell. Bitcoin was trading around $114,113 at press time following a pullback from recent highs of about $118K. The daily Relative Strength Index had fallen to 43, indicating a loss of bullish momentum without going into oversold levels. On-Balance Volume has been declining in the past week, indicating weakening buying pressure.

2025-08-03 18:30:00,49479258,1754245800,"Bitcoin (BTC) Slips Below $115K, but Analysts Still Predict $1M, What Crypto to Buy Now Before the Next Wave?","The crypto market is shifting gears, and while headlines focus on Bitcoin’s recent pullback, investors are already looking ahead. With BTC dipping under $115,000, some view it as a signal of cooling momentum—but for others, it’s the calm before another major run. One question keeps surfacing: if Bitcoin still has room to 10x long-term, what other cryptocurrency is poised to outperform before the next wave starts? That question is drawing attention to a growing DeFi project that’s still under the radar— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.035, it offers a rare opportunity to enter early with clear utility, real yield potential, and a strong roadmap. But before diving into that, let’s address Bitcoin’s current position and why its long-term outlook still drives optimism. Bitcoin (BTC) Dips, Long-Term Vision Holds Bitcoin’s recent slide below $115K may look alarming on the surface, but market analysts aren’t rattled. The pullback came amid renewed global trade uncertainty, short-term profit-taking, and thinner summer market activity. Still, BTC has held above its critical $110K support, and many believe this is just a pause within a broader bullish structure. Firms such as ARK Invest and Cantor Fitzgerald continue to support a strong long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Both expect the asset to reach $1 million by the end of the decade. This forecast is rooted in growing institutional demand, shrinking available supply, and Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity model. Notably, Cantor analysts cite capital reallocation by public companies and sovereign wealth strategies as key factors pushing the price beyond current highs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. It’s not just another token trying to ride the wave—Mutuum is building a decentralized infrastructure around real, scalable utility. Currently in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035, with over 14,700 holders already on board and more than $13.8 million raised to date. That level of early traction is notable for a project still in its pre-launch phase. Anyone getting in now is already locking in a short-term gain, with the listing price set at $0.06—a clear step up from the current entry point. But what’s driving attention even more is the potential for continued momentum once MUTM starts trading on major centralized exchanges. Considering the project’s utility, growing community, and post-launch roadmap, many believe the price won’t stop at $0.06. By locking in at $0.035 today, investors could see their entry appreciate by 200–300% over the coming months, especially as exchange listings, the platform’s beta release, and the buy-and-redistribute mechanism start to build momentum. Unlike projects that rely purely on hype, MUTM is backed by real DeFi features like lending, borrowing, and an overcollateralized stablecoin—giving it fundamentals that support long-term value, not just short-term speculation. This combination of early-stage pricing, token utility, and a clear rollout plan makes Mutuum Finance one of the best crypto projects to watch before the next market leg up. Why It’s Gaining Attention The protocol allows users to lend and borrow digital assets using smart contract-based pools, removing the need for centralized intermediaries. What sets it apart is how it balances both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending models, giving users flexibility based on their strategy and risk tolerance. Another standout feature is the introduction of an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted only when a borrower locks up sufficient assets. This stablecoin isn’t backed by a separate pool—it’s generated on demand and burned upon repayment. That makes it more efficient and resilient than many existing models. Holders who deposit assets into the system receive mtTokens, which automatically accumulate value from interest. These tokens represent the user’s share in the protocol and can be staked to earn passive rewards. And here’s where it gets even more interesting—the revenue from borrowing activity is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. It’s a self-contained yield engine that grows with platform activity. And with Layer 2 optimization in development, the team is pushing to reduce gas fees and scale usage further—key for any DeFi platform aiming to onboard more users. While Bitcoin’s path to $1 million is still unfolding, the question for many isn’t if BTC will rise again—it’s where to look while it consolidates. For those searching for the next big cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance offers a mix of timing, utility, and upside that few other tokens can match at this stage. With a fixed listing price of $0.06, a utility-driven ecosystem, and a token model designed for long-term sustainability, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most compelling investments of the year—especially before the broader market turns bullish again.

2025-08-03 18:29:00,49479257,1754245740,2 Altcoins That Could Eclipse Cardano (ADA) This Cycle – One Is Still Trading Below $0.10,"Cardano has always been a top altcoin within the blockchain world, typically on the list of Ethereum rivals. Yet while it’s still soaring in the portfolios of investors, the focus is shifting toward newer coins with more growth and actual usability. One such dark horse is gaining steam under the radar — and it’s still trading higher than $0.10. And with a successful presale and beta product already under its belt, this new crypto called Remittix (RTX) is poised to jump over many of the industry leaders. Cardano vs Litecoin – Which Legacy Alt Will Survive? Cardano (ADA) is at $0.7115, making steady but unimpressive gains. The blockchain features a peer-reviewed development process, but with that cautious strategy have come delays and missed chances in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Although maintaining a market capitalization of more than $25 billion, ADA’s expansion has decelerated. Recent updates like Hydra and Mithril have improved performance but the ecosystem still does not feel mass adoption of dApps and DeFi protocols similar to other networks. Litecoin (LTC), on the other hand, remains a solid contender because of its fast transactions and low fees. It is trading for $108.00 and has seen a 2.17% 24-hour gain. Its market capitalization stands at approximately $8.22 billion, and its volume is climbing gradually, aided by its reputation as a testing ground for Bitcoin. But even ADA and LTC have not been the ones to innovate in the area of utility. As the industry keeps moving towards utility-based use cases like crypto-to-fiat payments, remittance, and low gas fee crypto use cases, the two projects are now starting to look like legacy tech. The Real Challenger: Remittix (RTX) One project is filling this gap with a solution for an urgent real-world problem: sending and spending crypto as fiat. Remittix, currently priced at $0.0895 , is building a cross-chain wallet that facilitates real-time crypto-to-fiat transactions to bank accounts in more than 30 countries. As Cardano makes further progress towards real-world applications, Remittix already has raised more than $18 million in its current presale, with 579 million RTX tokens sold. It’s now firmly established that the Remittix Wallet Beta will launch live in Q3 2025, with Solana, Dogecoin, and other leading tokens supported.

2025-08-03 18:25:00,49478825,1754245500,3 Meme Coins To Watch and Buy in The First Week Of August 2025,"As August begins, meme coins spark excitement in the crypto community. These tokens combine community spirit, quirky stories, and growth potential, appealing to investors beyond traditional assets. Three coins stand out: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , SPX6900 (SPX), and Test Coin (TST). Here’s a closer look at what’s driving their traction and why they deserve a place on your radar. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Surpasses $13 Million in Presale Funds Little Pepe’s presale journey has been a steady climb rather than a sudden burst. A phased pricing model rewards early participants by gradually increasing token prices at each stage, encouraging timely entry and sustainable growth over sudden spikes. Currently in Stage 8, Little Pepe tokens are priced at $0.0017, and nearly 98% of the allocation for this stage has been claimed. The presale distributed over 8.9 billion tokens, raising over $13 million. Steady support highlights a strong community that values transparency and a community-focused approach. One of LILPEPE’s key strengths is its underlying technology. LILPEPE is built on Ethereum Layer 2, providing faster transactions with lower fees. As LILPEPE’s presale Stage 8 nears completion, excitement grows for Stage 9, which will further raise the token price. This prepares the meme coin for a solid foundation for future growth, institutional partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. LILPEPE’s presale performance, combined with its growing community and technical backbone, positions it as one of the meme coins with promising staying power in 2025. The LILPEPE team is also hosting a giveaway worth $770,000, with 10 lucky wallets each winning $77,000. This move is attracting both traders and crypto enthusiasts alike to partake in the meme coin’s presale. For those seeking exposure to a meme token that balances enthusiasm with real utility potential, Little Pepe is one to watch closely this month. SPX6900 (SPX) Hits New Highs Amid Technical Signals SPX6900 has quietly been making moves lately, hitting an all-time high of $2.21 and marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. The price action suggests that it has entered a discovery phase where buyers remain interested despite already strong performance. Technical analysis shows SPX targeting the 1.272 Fibonacci level near $3.07, based on earlier swings. MACD indicates bullish strength with a rising green histogram. RSI at 71 overbought signals caution. SPX’s recent gains and technical backdrop make it an intriguing meme coin for those who closely monitor charts. It’s a token riding the wave of momentum, but also reminding investors to manage risk carefully as it approaches critical resistance levels. Test Coin (TST): The Meme That Refused to Fade Test Coin has a unique story in the meme coin scene. It started as a joke, launched on a developer network with low expectations. Despite this, the community embraced it, turning it into a decentralized governance experiment and meme culture symbol. With over $4.5 million in trading volume and a DAO voting on quirky updates, Test Coin is known for unpredictability and humor. Last week’s stunt replaced the website with a QR code linking to a Nicolas Cage meme, which coincidentally caused a price rise. Despite—or perhaps because of—its lack of conventional utility, Test Coin has become one of the most talked-about memecoins of 2025. Enthusiasts affectionately call it “the coin with no utility that outperformed half of Solana,” underscoring its viral momentum. Final Thoughts As August 2025 begins, the meme coin scene continues to buzz with activity. Little Pepe combines community, tech, and transparent presale for long-term growth. The SPX6900 remains bullish but risks becoming overbought. Test Coin surprises with unique memes and decentralized choices. Observing these projects may reveal future winners.

2025-08-03 18:15:55,49478561,1754244955,Exploring High Potential Cryptocurrencies Beyond the Mainstream,"Amidst the bustling activity of cryptocurrency markets, Pepe Coin has been a frequent topic of discussion due to its potential to achieve a market cap of $50 billion. However, the spotlight is now shifting to lesser-known, low-cap coins such as Remittix (RTX) , which are poised for significant growth. Remittix, in particular, is creating buzz with its ongoing presale and the development of a utility-driven product that aims to streamline financial transactions across borders. This shift in focus from high-cap, hype-driven coins to utility-based low-cap gems could redefine investment strategies in the crypto space. The Appeal of Low-Cap Cryptocurrencies Low-cap cryptocurrencies like Remittix offer a unique appeal due to their potential for rapid appreciation. Their smaller market caps mean they can experience significant price movements from relatively modest investments, attracting both retail and experienced investors seeking high returns. Remittix: A Closer Look at its Market Potential Remittix stands out not just for its promising financial technology but also for its strategic market positioning. With a live presale that has already captivated a considerable audience, Remittix is paving the way for substantial growth in the fintech sector. Remittix's upcoming product, the Remittix Wallet, is slated for release in Q3 2025. It promises to support crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, accommodating a wide range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. This innovation is particularly aimed at freelancers, expatriates, and small businesses who require efficient, cost-effective international payment solutions. Why Investors are Turning to Remittix The current financial landscape demands more than just digital assets; it requires solutions that resolve actual economic and transactional challenges. Remittix addresses these needs head-on, distinguishing itself from other meme-driven cryptocurrencies, including the more popular Pepe Coin and Troll (SOL). While Pepe Coin might boast a robust market cap and Troll (SOL) shows occasional price spikes, their growth is largely fueled by market sentiment rather than underlying utility. Remittix's approach, which combines a strong technological foundation with practical financial solutions, presents a more sustainable growth trajectory. As the crypto market evolves, the focus is gradually shifting from speculative investments towards those that offer real-world applications. This pivot could see projects like Remittix not just succeeding but potentially dominating the PayFi sector.

2025-08-03 18:15:22,49478211,1754244922,"Pepe Coin Could Hit $50 B, But Analysts Say The Real 100x Gains Lie in These Low‑Cap Gems","Memecoin markets are in an uproar. As Pepe Coin looms over headlines with the possibility of reaching a $50 billion market cap, various analysts speculate that low-cap gems like Remittix (RTX) have much higher potential for upside. With an actual product under production and a live presale already generating hype, Remittix is quickly becoming a utility-based altcoin that may be overshadowing the hype. Let's see the key stats and why it could beat the hype-driven big boys. Pepe Coin and Troll (SOL): Prices, Market Caps, and Volume Trends Pepe Coin is quoted at around $0.00001009, down 4.3%, with a market cap of around $4.29 billion and a daily volume of $712 million, down nearly 27%. Troll (SOL), a low-cap meme token listed on Solana, is currently trading at $0.062–$0.063 today, up over 20%, with a market cap of roughly $62 million and volume of roughly $14–15 million, though that amount dipped by 27% recently. These numbers show how fast meme tokens can pump—or bleed. But none of them address a real problem in the crypto space. Why Low‑Cap Crypto Gems Attract Analyst Attention Meme coins are constructed on hype on the internet. But now, experts think low-cap projects that actually address real-life issues will make the biggest profits. Pepe Coin has brand power, and Troll (SOL) has timing—but both are sentiment and speculation-driven. Investors looking for the next 100x crypto are gravitating toward crypto that has actual utility and low gas fee crypto alternatives. And that's where an underdog challenger enters the picture. Hello Remittix: A Utility‑Driven Player in the Cryptosphere Remittix (RTX) is causing a buzz with its price of just $0.0895 per token , having sold over 579 million tokens and raising $18 million. There is still a 50% bonus available in its ongoing presale. The Remittix Wallet—which is coming in Q3 2025—will enable crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, supporting 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. It boasts real-time FX conversion, low gas fees, and mobile-first UX optimized for international consumers like freelancers, expats, and small businesses. Why Remittix Can Be the Real Winner Among Low-Caps Utility-first approach: Serves global payment inefficiencies Presale traction: $18 Million+ raised, 579Million+ tokens sold Beta wallet on the horizon: Launches Q3 2025 Big bonus: 50% extra tokens for early adopters $250,000 giveaway: Offers extra incentive for new users With real tech behind it and real use cases driving it, Remittix is being seen as the best crypto presale 2025. It's not here to win the meme war—it's here to win crypto's next utility race. Pepe Coin could easily go to a $50 billion market cap, and Troll (SOL) could have some additional waves. But it's initiatives like Remittix that bring value—and that is what experts hold drives sustainable 100x growth.

2025-08-03 18:14:02,49478426,1754244842,Market Trends: Decline in Solana's Value and Rising Interest in Remittix,"Recent market trends have shown a stark decline in the value of Solana (SOL), once a high-flying cryptocurrency. Analysts predict further reductions in its price come August. In contrast, the PayFi sector, led by innovations like Remittix (RTX), is experiencing a surge in investor interest due to its practical utility in real-world financial transactions. Solana's decline from over $200 to fluctuating prices around $160 has incited a broader conversation about the sustainability of certain cryptocurrencies under market pressures. The sharp downturn of Solana's valuation, despite reaching a high of $205, has led to heightened caution among investors and a pivot towards alternatives that offer more than speculative value. The Appeal of Remittix as a PayFi Solution In the wake of Solana's fluctuating market performance, traders and investors are increasingly turning their attention to Remittix , a platform that promises to seamlessly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency. This utility is particularly appealing in an environment where many are looking for stability and real-world application. Remittix's approach to PayFi, which facilitates instant liquidity of digital assets, is drawing significant interest. This is evident from the platform's rapid growth and the traction it's gaining amidst the current market volatility. Technical Analysis and Market Predictions for Solana The technical analysis for Solana shows a bearish trend with key indicators like the RSI and MACD reflecting a potential further drop. Market experts suggest that if Solana breaks below the $160 support level, it could see prices as low as $150 in the near future. This instability is prompting traders to diversify their portfolios, with many looking towards more secure and utility-based cryptocurrencies like RTX. The rapid pivot from hype-driven investments like meme coins to platforms that offer tangible financial solutions is reshaping investor strategies. Remittix is emblematic of this shift, with its PayFi model providing immediate crypto-to-fiat conversions without the need for traditional banking infrastructure. Future Prospects and Developments Looking ahead, Remittix is not just weathering the current crypto storm but thriving within it. With plans to launch the Remittix Wallet beta soon, the platform is setting the stage for significant growth in the PayFi domain. This positions RTX as a practical and promising investment amidst the broader crypto market's volatility. Moreover, the upcoming $250,000 Remittix Giveaway to celebrate the wallet launch underscores the platform's commitment to growing its user base and enhancing its visibility in the fintech sector.

2025-08-03 18:13:17,49478174,1754244797,"Market Analysts Warn Of Further Solana (SOL) Slump In August, Prompting Traders To Reposition In Remittix (RTX)","Solana’s sharp reversal has spooked the market. After peaking above $200, Solana Price is now slipping fast, with analysts warning of more downside in August. Meanwhile, traders aren’t waiting around. Many are already rotating into Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi crypto offering real-world utility. With SOL stalling, RTX is gaining attention as the smarter, safer play in an increasingly shaky altcoin environment. Solana Price Crashes Below $170 After Sharp Weekly Drop Solana’s bullish momentum has taken a sharp turn. After briefly crossing $205 in late July, the SOL Price has now dropped over 20%, sitting closer to $160. The pullback isn’t surprising given the overheated rally, but the sudden reversal has sparked concern among investors. The Solana Price today reflects growing caution, especially with Bitcoin dominance rising and altcoin strength fading. The Solana Price Prediction for August now leans bearish, with technicals showing declining RSI and a MACD that just flipped downward. Traders have noted SOL Price is struggling to hold above the $160 support. If it breaks, analysts say a slide toward $150 isn’t off the table. The SOL News cycle has also shifted focus—from meme coin hype to broader ecosystem development. That pivot may be good long-term, but in the short run, it’s left Solana exposed. Platforms like pump.fun aren’t pulling as much retail activity, and newer Layer 2 chains like Base are stealing the spotlight. Despite maintaining solid daily active address counts, the Solana Price has suffered from fading momentum and profit-taking pressure. Many traders are now diversifying into alternatives. Remittix (RTX), for example, has quietly attracted serious capital thanks to its PayFi focus and crypto-to-fiat utility. Compared to Solana News driven by speculation, Remittix offers something grounded—and it’s gaining traction quickly. Remittix Emerges As Top Pick Amid Solana Price Decline While Solana news shows growing weakness, a different project is quietly winning trader confidence. Remittix (RTX) has stepped into the spotlight as a more grounded bet—especially with SOL losing momentum and slipping below key levels. Rather than depending on hype, Remittix delivers what many in crypto talk about but rarely offer: real utility. Its PayFi model turns crypto into spendable fiat in seconds. No centralized exchanges. No long wait times. Just direct, usable money. While traders worry about the SOL Price Prediction in August, Remittix is pushing forward. It’s already raised over $18 million, sold more than 579 million tokens, and now gears up for its biggest product milestone yet—the Remittix Wallet beta on September 15. Remittix investors now enjoy: A working PayFi system designed for real-world crypto-to-fiat usage Growing support from analysts who favor utility over volatility Stable demand while meme coins and large caps dip Access to the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway during wallet launch rollout Remittix isn’t fighting the trend—it’s redefining it.

2025-08-03 18:11:46,49478397,1754244706,Exploring the Rise of Remittix Amidst the Decline of Cardano and Shiba Inu,"Recent Struggles in the Cryptocurrency Market The digital currency landscape has seen dramatic shifts, with established players like Cardano and Shiba Inu experiencing notable declines. Cardano, after achieving a July peak, saw a sharp 15% drop in value, negating significant gains from earlier in the year. Similarly, Shiba Inu's price plummeted, erasing a substantial portion of its recent rally. This downturn in both assets highlights the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency markets and investor sentiment influenced by broader economic events and internal ecosystem changes. The Emergence of Remittix In contrast to the struggles faced by Cardano and Shiba Inu, Remittix is gaining traction as a robust contender in the blockchain space. With a focus on creating a seamless PayFi ecosystem that facilitates instant crypto-to-bank transfers, Remittix addresses the inefficiencies plaguing the $190 trillion cross-border payments market. This innovative platform is not just a concept but a rapidly developing project aiming for a Q3 2025 wallet beta launch. Remittix is designed to integrate over 40 cryptocurrencies, facilitating real-time fiat settlements, which is a significant step forward in merging crypto economies with traditional financial systems. Technical Challenges and Market Responses While Remittix is on the rise, the technical indicators for Cardano and Shiba Inu show potential further declines. Cardano's active addresses have decreased, reaching a low not seen since November 2024, which could indicate a reducing user base or waning interest. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, despite a significant token burn, has not seen a corresponding uplift in price, suggesting that market sentiment remains bearish. Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Remittix is poised to redefine the standards for financial transactions across borders. By enabling crypto-to-bank transfers in seconds and supporting multi-chain functionality, Remittix promises low transaction costs and high efficiency, making it an attractive option for both businesses and individual users. Moreover, the platform's strategic initiatives, such as the $250,000 community giveaway, aim to bolster early adoption and create a robust user base ahead of its official launch. Join the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway As the crypto market continues to evolve, Remittix provides a compelling investment opportunity, especially considering the potential downturns facing more established cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Shiba Inu.

2025-08-03 18:11:09,49478092,1754244669,"Cardano and Shiba Inu Erase July Gains, But This Viral Crypto Looks Set To Extend 500% Gains","Cardano (ADA) has fallen 15% from its July peak of $0.92 to $0.69, erasing a 53% rally sparked by the Chang Hard Fork and governance upgrades. Shiba Inu (SHIB) followed suit, wiping out more than half of its July gains. As these top altcoins struggle to regain footing, smart money investors are eyeing a new 100x crypto candidate with real-world use cases and sustained momentum. Which new crypto token launch is analysts’ top pick for best crypto investment in 2025? Let’s find out. Cardano’s Technical Breakdown Signals Deeper Correction Despite major upgrades, Cardano has broken below key $0.85 support, now trading near $0.69 with RSI at 37, indicating possible further downside. The drop comes as Cardano daily active addresses slide to 21,500, lowest since November 2024 and on the back of the market pullback in reaction to Trump’s new EU tariffs . Analysts are split: some see ADA rebounding if it reclaims $0.85, targeting $1.50 in a cycle similar to 2021 , while others warn of a deeper correction toward $0.70 or even $0.65. Cardano’s rigorous development model has yielded over 1,300 projects and $412M in Total Value Locked, but slower adoption and user experience challenges leave it lagging behind newer, more agile competitors . Shiba Inu Supply Faces Inflation Amidst Burn Rate Decline SHIB has tumbled 16% from July highs despite a one-day burn of 600M tokens, a 374,629% spike. Yet price performance remains disconnected from burn activity. Technicals show weakness: SHIB has dropped below its 50-day EMA, with RSI below 50 and falling volumes. While SHIB celebrates 5 years and 21,600,000% historical gains, reduced Shibarium usage and waning open interest suggest fading momentum and Shib Inu price may fall toward $0.0000094 if selling continues. Remittix: Extending 500% Growth Through Real-World Utility As ADA and Shiba Inu prices retrace, Remittix's mission to bank every individual is gaining steam. The top DeFi company is building a PayFi ecosystem to enable instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, directly solving inefficiencies in the $190 Trillion cross-border payments market. Set for a Q3 2025 wallet beta launch, RTX combines real-world utility with strong tokenomics. Its multi-chain Pay API lets businesses accept 40+ cryptos while settling in fiat instantly, addressing true market demand without relying on hype or token burns alone. Key Remittix Features Capturing Whale Interest Enterprise Pay API: Accept 40+ cryptos, get fiat instantly with compliance and treasury tools. Real-Time Settlement: Crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries in seconds. Mobile Wallet Launch (Q3 2025): Real-time FX conversion for global users. Low Gas Fees: Multi-chain support for Ethereum, Solana, and others.

Participants earn RTX through referrals, content creation, and engagement, while ADA and SHIB face bearish pressure.

This correction has sparked a divide among analysts and investors, with some viewing it as a healthy retracement that could set the stage for a continuation of the broader uptrend. Others, however, warn that this move might signal the beginning of a more extended bearish phase if key support levels fail to hold. Related Reading: Ethereum New Addresses Surge To Nearly 257K In A Day, Matching 2017 And 2021 Bull Markets Adding to the market’s uncertainty, top analyst Darkfost highlighted a significant shift in exchange activity. Data reveals that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have been steadily rising since early July, reversing a prolonged downtrend that had been in place since March. Given Binance’s position as the largest global crypto exchange by volume, this uptick in inflows is a crucial indicator of shifting investor behavior. Whether this trend signals an upcoming wave of selling or simply reflects portfolio rebalancing remains to be seen. The coming days will be pivotal as Bitcoin tests its lower demand zones and market sentiment reacts to this new data. Binance Bitcoin Inflows Signal Shift in Market Mood Darkfost shared critical data showing that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have steadily increased, rising from approximately 5,300 BTC daily in early July to 7,000 BTC today. While this uptick is not abrupt, it marks a significant reversal of a prolonged downtrend that had persisted since March. This change suggests that investor behavior is shifting, potentially signaling adjustments in market strategies as traders and institutions respond to evolving market dynamics. Binance, as the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by trading volume, serves as a critical barometer for overall market sentiment. With over 250 million users and billions of dollars in daily transactions, fluctuations in Bitcoin inflows on this platform often mirror broader structural moves within the crypto market. Historically, rising inflows have been associated with increased trading activity, whether due to profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or anticipation of market volatility. Some analysts interpret this emerging trend of accelerating inflows as an early sign of preparation for heightened market volatility or impending macroeconomic shifts. It could indicate that traders are positioning funds on exchanges to either capitalize on price swings or hedge against potential downside risks. While the magnitude of inflows isn’t alarmingly high yet, the consistency of this rise demands attention. The market is watching closely to see whether this signals a temporary adjustment or the start of a broader trend. With Bitcoin’s price currently testing lower support zones after breaking below $115K, the behavior of these inflows will be pivotal in determining short-term price action. Related Reading: Exchanges Receive 21,400 Bitcoin At A Loss From Short-Term Holders – Retail Capitulation? Key Support At Risk Amid Increased Selling Pressure Bitcoin is trading at $112,477 after breaking down from its two-week consolidation range. The price lost the crucial $115,724 support, which now flips into immediate resistance. This breakdown marks a significant shift in momentum, with BTC testing the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $114,944, which failed to hold. The next key support zone lies near the 200-day SMA at $110,348, a level that could become pivotal for bulls attempting to regain control. Volume has surged during this decline, indicating strong selling pressure as BTC approaches the $112,000 level. If the price fails to hold above this zone, a further drop towards the psychological $110K level seems likely, with potential for a deeper correction targeting previous accumulation ranges from early July.

Despite the bearish short-term outlook, bulls still have a chance to reclaim momentum if they can swiftly push BTC back above $115,724 and establish a consolidation above the 50-day SMA at $117,631. Until then, market sentiment remains cautious as investors watch for signs of demand absorption or further liquidation-driven declines.

2025-08-03 07:58:26,49457460,1754207906,Analyst: I Repeat- $6-$8 XRP Price In August Highly Likely,"While XRP has faced pressure in recent sessions, a new analysis suggests that the current correction could be nearing completion. In a chart posted on August 2, trader and crypto analyst Xoom (@Mr_Xoom) outlined a potential bullish reversal zone as XRP trades around the $2.93 mark. The chart indicates a classic five-wave Elliott Wave pattern , where wave 5 is projected to finalize around $2.8. The chart highlights a series of lower highs and lower lows from late July into early August. After completing Waves 1 to 5, the chart outlines the potential endpoint, which falls around the $2.8 zone that Xoom previously set as the XRP’s lowest point for this cycle. XRP Ltf wave 5 coming to an end. I repeat- $6-$8 XRP in August highly likely. https://t.co/whkoyP1vM5 pic.twitter.com/2lPXPs5ybR — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 2, 2025 Support Zone Under Scrutiny XRP recently experienced a notable decline, falling below the crucial $3 support zone . It has failed to reclaim this level, causing some concern among market participants. Xoom outlined this level on the chart, as it held up XRP in July after the asset retraced from its all-time high . Although XRP has broken through this support, Xoom is confident in the technical structure and anticipates a recovery. Despite the recent decline, XRP has remained above the highlighted support at $2.8, and the current forecast implies that once wave 5 concludes, a larger reversal could follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bearish Momentum is Slowing Down Elliott Wave theory, the analytical framework used in the chart, typically identifies patterns of investor behavior. A completed five-wave downtrend often precedes a corrective rally or a new impulsive move in the opposite direction. In this case, Xoom appears to anticipate the latter, which would imply a significant upside breakout if the projected reversal plays out. At the time of Xoom’s analysis, XRP sat slightly above the $2.8 support, trading around $2.93. The bearish sequence, while still active, appears to be losing momentum, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Outlook for August Remains Bullish Despite the short-term bearish structure, the forecast remains optimistic over the coming weeks. Xoom reiterated his previous target, stating that XRP reaching $6 to $8 in August is highly likely . The projected target range represents a more than 2x increase from current levels at the minimum. While that may seem ambitious, the underlying structure of the wave analysis supports the case for a trend shift if the $2.80 support holds firm.

The image, described as one of the most comprehensive and clear visualizations of XRP’s total supply, reiterates the essential breakdown of XRP holdings, including those in escrow, in active circulation, and under Ripple’s control. The data visualization provides insight into how XRP is distributed across different categories, emphasizing the constraints on Ripple’s ability to liquidate large portions of the asset. Still the best infographic about total #XRP circulation, updated. (SBI Holdings fiscal year end report) ~36b left in escrow.. pic.twitter.com/GniV4tFO3P — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 1, 2025 XRP Market Circulation and Total Supply The maximum supply of XRP remains capped at 100 billion tokens. According to the infographic, approximately 59.24 billion XRP are in active circulation within the market. At the time of reporting, this portion of XRP carries a market capitalization of approximately 28.6 trillion Japanese yen, based on pricing data from July 28. This figure reflects a substantial segment of the total supply and constitutes the portion that is freely tradable across exchanges and platforms. Ripple’s Non-Circulating Holdings As of the end of March 2025, Ripple held a significant volume of XRP that had not entered the market. These holdings are categorized as being outside of current market circulation and are valued at approximately 13.4 trillion yen. By July 20, 2025, the infographic reports that Ripple’s non-circulating holdings are equivalent to 19.7 trillion yen, which suggests that the valuation is based on a revised XRP price as of July 28. These tokens represent a portion of the supply Ripple retains direct control over, yet has not introduced into active trading markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Under Escrow and Burned Supply A prominent feature of the report is the quantification of XRP held under escrow . Roughly 35.9 billion XRP remain locked under the escrow mechanism. The infographic explains that XRP placed in escrow on the XRP Ledger is restricted from use or destruction until specific conditions are met. The escrow system was established to promote predictability and ensure responsible token release over time. Based on ledger data available as of July 20, 2025, the report confirms that nearly 40% of the total XRP supply is still under escrow, and thus, Ripple is not at liberty to sell or distribute these tokens at will. In addition to circulating and escrowed tokens, the infographic indicates that approximately 10 million XRP have been permanently removed from the total supply through transaction fees. These burned tokens represent a fraction of the total but reflect the deflationary nature of the transaction cost model built into the XRP Ledger. Summary of Data Presentation and Source The quantities shown in the infographic are derived from XRP Ledger data as of July 20, 2025, and the monetary valuations are calculated using XRP’s market price as of July 28. WrathofKahneman referred to the updated image as “still the best infographic about total XRP circulation,” highlighting its clarity and the credibility of its source, which is SBI Holdings. The visual report illustrates the current landscape of XRP distribution in quantifiable detail and offers transparency on Ripple’s available and restricted holdings.

2025-08-03 07:19:07,49457457,1754205547,BlackRock and Ripple Are Acting In Sync Quietly but on a Massive Scale,"Crypto enthusiast Cosmos has presented a detailed analysis asserting that Ripple and BlackRock are acting in coordination to reshape the financial system through tokenization. According to Cosmo, both entities are quietly aligning operations, timelines, and personnel to build a tokenized infrastructure that affects not just financial instruments, but also identity, medical data, and global market architecture. The claims, supported by multiple references to known partnerships and developments, attempt to demonstrate a systemic realignment of the digital asset space led by Ripple and BlackRock. Cosmo opens the thread by stating that BlackRock and Ripple have “just been exposed,” and suggests they are using tokenization as a vehicle to control financial markets. The tweet asserts that the same assets are being targeted, within the same timeframe, and involving the same key players behind both initiatives. The central argument is that this coordinated effort is being largely overlooked despite its significant implications for crypto holders and the broader financial ecosystem. Ripple’s Role in Tokenizing Traditional Assets Cosmo traces the beginning of this effort to Ripple’s early work in tokenizing U.S. Treasury bonds using the XRP Ledger . This was done through the OUSG fund, which is accessible in tokenized form on-chain 24/7. According to Cosmo, this marks a fundamental shift in how traditional securities are accessed and transferred. He further notes that BlackRock has allocated capital into this very fund, highlighting their indirect participation in the XRPL tokenization effort . 1^ ✰ BlackRock and Ripple are acting in sync – quietly but on a massive scale ✰ They are launching tokenization to rewrite the financial system ✰ Same assets – same timeline – same people – and no one is asking questions pic.twitter.com/OqcdS41fhA — Cosmo (@0xcosmobtc) July 31, 2025 Ondo Finance is identified as the intermediary platform responsible for launching the OUSG token. Cosmo describes Ondo as a fintech project led by former Goldman Sachs executives. The role breakdown, as Cosmo explains, places Ripple as the provider of the blockchain infrastructure, Ondo as the issuer of the tokenized instruments, and BlackRock as the source of capital liquidity. He also notes that Ripple’s legal clarity following its partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 was a strategic milestone that enabled this expansion into institutional partnerships. New Developments Involving Bio-Identification and the XRP Ledger A point of coincidence emphasized by Cosmo is the ticker symbol $XDNA. BlackRock currently has a genetics ETF trading under this ticker. Meanwhile, on July 4, 2025, a token with the same ticker, $XDNA, is set to launch on the XRP Ledger. Cosmo states that this new token is being issued by DNA Protocol and is centered on biometric identity infrastructure, medical data access, and genomics, rather than trading. He states that the XRPL will serve as the foundational blockchain for this infrastructure, further demonstrating Ripple’s reach into areas beyond finance. This development, according to Cosmo, represents the convergence of healthcare data, biometric identification, and tokenized infrastructure within a single blockchain environment. He notes that this should not be viewed in isolation but rather as an extension of Ripple’s broader role in building systems for the next era of digital infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock’s Expanding Blockchain Integration Cosmo also refers to the ISO 20022 messaging standard , currently being implemented by FedWire, SWIFT, and global banks. He points out that Ripple’s systems have been compatible with ISO 20022 from inception. In contrast, BlackRock’s Aladdin software, which manages over $20 trillion in assets, is now testing blockchain networks for settlement and transaction tracking. Cosmos states that XRPL supports ISO 20022 and operates without interruption, positioning it as a viable base layer for next-generation financial systems. According to Cosmo, the two firms are dividing responsibilities across multiple verticals. Ripple is focusing on the tokenization of government bonds, central bank digital currencies, land, and carbon markets. BlackRock is focusing on tokenizing equities, U.S. treasuries, real estate, and digital identity. Cosmo interprets this as a dual effort to reboot the global financial system from the ground up, operating in unison but through separate domains. Effect on the Broader Crypto Market In the final portion of the thread, Cosmo argues that the implications of this transformation affect all crypto holders. He says that anyone holding assets like Ethereum or Solana is already part of this evolving structure, regardless of whether they are aware. Cosmo warns that the shift is not about adopting a new market, but rather transitioning the current system into a more centralized form under different management. He ends the thread with a caution that this transformation is not optional. According to his view, tokenization led by Ripple and BlackRock is already in motion, and retail participants are being absorbed into an institutional framework without a clear understanding of the broader design.

2025-08-03 07:12:20,49457384,1754205140,Dogecoin Dragged Lower by Outflows With Technicals Flagging Bearish Continuation,"Dogecoin fell 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), slipping from $0.20 to as low as $0.19 amid sharp spikes in trading activity and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins. What to Know DOGE traded in a volatile $0.01 range (7.14%) during the session, declining from $0.20 to $0.19 before staging a mild bounce. Volume surged to 918.53M at 06:00 and 502.81M at 14:00, both exceeding the 24H average of 385.67M, signaling high-conviction exits. Support formed around $0.188–$0.190, where volume spiked to 667.44M, enabling a brief recovery to $0.194. Resistance held at $0.202–$0.203, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. News Background DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets. Price Action Summary High: $0.203 Low: $0.188 Close: $0.195 24H Range: $0.015 (7.14%) Technical Analysis DOGE encountered aggressive resistance at the $0.202–$0.203 zone, rejecting multiple rallies. The $0.188–$0.190 region absorbed peak selling pressure, with high-volume prints suggesting bottom-fishing or accumulation interest. The final 60-minute session (03:55–04:54) saw a measured 0.53% drop from $0.196 to $0.195, with intra-candle resistance at $0.1963 and support near $0.1952. Volumes normalized late in the session, but remain above baseline, indicating potential for continued volatility. What Traders Are Watching Whether DOGE can hold $0.19 support or break down further amid broader altcoin weakness. Macro risk factors such as U.S. rate path, global trade policy shifts, and liquidity rotations away from meme assets.",Markets|News,EN,0,dogecoin fell period ending august slipping low amid sharp spike trading activity persistent macroeconomic headwind move came risk sentiment deteriorated globally triggering institutional outflow across volatile crypto asset particularly meme coin know doge traded volatile range session declining staging mild bounce volume surged exceeding average signaling exit support formed around volume spiked enabling brief recovery resistance held repeatedly rejecting upside attempt news background doge decline came amid renewed global trade tension following expiration reciprocal tariff framework left country facing elevated trade barrier federal reserve held rate steady week opting monitor trade data reduced market odds september rate cut weighed heavily asset price action summary high low close range technical analysis doge encountered aggressive resistance zone rejecting multiple rally region absorbed peak selling pressure print suggesting accumulation interest final session saw measured drop resistance support near volume normalized late session remain baseline indicating potential continued volatility trader watching whether doge hold support break amid broader altcoin weakness macro risk factor rate path global trade policy shift liquidity rotation away meme asset,0.167,0.699,0.134,-0.2023,0

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.537 (-0.5%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.55 24-hour low $0.52 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 0.537154 Price Prediction $ 0.404436 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.64% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.578797 200-Day SMA $ 0.71533 14-Day RSI 39.88 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6081 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.5036 The dYdX price analysis for 3 August confirms that dYdX faced a drop as it attempted a move below $0.54. Currently, buyers are accumulating heavily, resulting in a consolidation. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price declines toward $0.54 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price attempted to maintain momentum above $0.66. As a result, buyers are now holding dYdX price around resistance lines, preparing for further upward push. The 24-hour volume surged to $5.07 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.539, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around 38, hinting that sellers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price below the EMA trend lines. Currently, sellers are holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.18, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.684049 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.670481 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.653003 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.655128 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.578797 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.613287 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.71533 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.602108 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.592156 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.589295 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.602966 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.663086 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.804666 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.024835 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6081, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6621. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5036, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4396. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers lost confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.54 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.5 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility.

As a result, dYdX recorded over 3% decline in July. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.9 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $1.2, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction August 2025 $0.45 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Houston resident Sharon Schoolcraft says she lost $13,000 after receiving a call from someone claiming to be working at Wells Fargo, reports FOX 26. Schoolcraft says the caller alerted her to possible fraudulent charges made to her account, a facade made believable by the fact that the scammer knew about recent charges she had legitimately made. The scammer subsequently told Schoolcraft that someone would come to her home to cut up or collect her cut-up Wells Fargo debit card. Similar scams have affected other Wells Fargo customers. Recent reports suggest a trend of scammers convincing the bank’s customers that their accounts are at risk, tricking them into giving up their PINs, cutting up their bank cards and then meeting someone in person to hand over the cut-up cards so the thieves can either withdraw funds or transfer money out of the accounts. In previous instances, when requesting a refund from the bank, the victims were denied by Wells Fargo. However, the bank’s decision changed when the media investigated the matter. Similarly, Wells Fargo only agreed to refund Schoolcraft her stolen $13,000 after the media got involved. Says Schoolcraft, “I’m so super stoked, it’s going to mean a lot to me. I can pay back the person I had to borrow money from. I can get my bills back on track.

The FCA had previously barred retail access to crypto ETNs in 2021, citing investor protection concerns. However, with the market maturing and some crypto investment products now better understood, the regulator said it will allow access, provided the ETNs are listed on recognized, FCA-approved U.K.-based exchanges. Products must follow financial promotion rules to prevent misleading advertising and inappropriate incentives. The FCA’s Consumer Duty rules, which require firms to avoid causing foreseeable harm, will apply. The FCA warned, however, that there won’t be coverage under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for these products.

2025-08-03 06:30:06,49457461,1754202606,Top 3 Most Undervalued Cryptocurrencies to Watch Right Now,"While Bitcoin dominates headlines, some of the most promising crypto opportunities are hiding in plain sight—trading well below their all-time highs and quietly setting up for major upside. As seasoned investors look for high-upside entry points, one fast-growing project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has caught attention for its explosive growth metrics and expanding user base. Ethereum’s Rebound Hasn’t Hit Its Ceiling Yet Ethereum (ETH) remains one of the most fundamentally sound assets in crypto, yet it’s still undervalued relative to its potential. Currently priced at $3,740, ETH is trading more than 20% below its all-time high of $4,720. Meanwhile, corporate holdings of Ethereum have surpassed $10 billion, and ETF inflows remain steady. Despite that bullish backdrop, technical momentum remains neutral, with an RSI of ~31, suggesting room for upward movement once buy-side volume picks up. A clean breakout above $4,000 could trigger rapid continuation. One New Project Is Quickly Escaping Hidden Gem Status Among altcoins seeing fast-tracked growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out of obscurity. According to on-chain metrics, MAGACOIN has recently crossed multiple internal benchmarks for user acquisition, transaction volume, and community engagement. A newly completed third-party blockchain audit has also positioned the project as a top-tier safety pick —a factor that has drawn attention from cautious but ROI-focused investors. $2,500 deployed here could turn into $50,000 , based on similar market cap trajectories seen in early-stage coins that achieved wide exchange listings. Cardano’s Discount May Not Last Long Cardano (ADA) is another altcoin hovering well below its peak, currently priced at just $0.75—a far cry from its former all-time high of $3.01. Despite recent bearish action bringing ADA down to around $0.743, RSI levels near 30.27 indicate heavy overselling. Historically, similar RSI readings have preceded major recoveries for ADA. Its strong developer activity and continued expansion into smart contracts make it a serious contender for long-term gains if it can reclaim investor confidence. Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano remain undervalued giants with significant recovery potential. But the real momentum may be forming around MAGACOIN FINANCE, now gaining recognition as one of the safest and most promising new altcoin investments . For investors hunting undervalued assets with strong growth curves, these three should be on the radar right now.

2025-08-03 06:10:09,49457381,1754201409,Trump Media Confirms $2B Bitcoin Treasury and $300M Options Strategy in Q2 2025 Earnings Report,"Trump Media and Technology Group (Nasdaq: DJT) disclosed Friday that it now holds $2 billion in bitcoin and bitcoin-related securities, officially confirming one of the largest digital asset treasuries among U.S.-listed companies. The announcement came via the company’s second quarter of 2025 earnings press release , which also mentioned $3.1 billion in total financial assets and its first-ever quarter of positive operating cash flow. The crypto holdings were first disclosed in a separate press release dated July 21. The company also said it has allocated $300 million toward an options-based strategy focused on bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets, signaling ongoing intent to expand its exposure. According to the July 21 release, this strategy could allow Trump Media to convert options into spot BTC “depending on market conditions,” and potentially use the resulting positions for revenue generation or further crypto accumulation. The $2 billion figure cited includes not only spot bitcoin but also bitcoin-related securities, such as bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bitcoin trusts, or derivatives that offer BTC exposure. These instruments allow institutional investors to gain indirect access to bitcoin price movements while avoiding direct custody or on-chain interaction. By combining these securities with spot bitcoin, Trump Media has constructed a hybrid crypto treasury intended to offer both liquidity and resilience. The second quarter also marked the company’s first quarter of positive operating cash flow, with $2.3 million generated through its media and technology operations. Total financial assets reached $3.1 billion, fueled primarily by the crypto treasury build-up and a recent private placement backed by 50 institutional investors. CEO Devin Nunes said that the liquidity and “financial freedom” afforded by this capital will help Trump Media pursue a range of product expansions, including a Truth+ streaming bundle, AI integrations, and a planned utility token for payments within the Truth Social ecosystem. The company also reiterated its goal of launching multiple crypto-focused ETFs and managed investment products.

While these dominant names attract attention, traders are now gravitating toward newer Layer 1 projects offering better utility and growth potential. One project gaining serious traction is BlockDAG. It stands apart from typical presales by showcasing a live testnet, 2 million+ active mobile miners, and over 4,500 developers building real dApps. Currently priced at only $0.0016, BDAG promises a staggering 3,025% ROI, with early buyers already witnessing a 2,660% surge since batch 1. This price holds until August 11th, adding urgency for buyers. BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active and features a “NO VESTING PASS” offer, giving users full token access at launch. In this article, we’ll stack up Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BlockDAG to see which ones stand among the top cryptos to buy today. BlockDAG (BDAG) Few projects have managed to turn heads the way BlockDAG (BDAG) has. With presale funding exceeding $359 million and over 24.6 billion coins sold, this project is gathering steam as it nears its global rollout. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0016, which stays active until August 11th, while the official listing price remains $0.05, a setup that offers a powerful 3,025% profit window. BDAG has already delivered 2,660% gains to early supporters since batch 1. The “NO VESTING PASS” sweetens the deal, allowing holders to unlock 100% of their coins immediately upon launch. But what truly separates BlockDAG is its existing infrastructure, a fully functioning testnet, over 2 million miners using the X1 app, and 18,000+ plug-and-play X10 miners sold. With more than 300 applications already in development from 4,500+ builders, BlockDAG’s traction speaks volumes. This isn’t just an idea, it’s a full-blown, ready-to-use ecosystem, making it one of the top cryptos to buy today based on current momentum, structure, and timing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto market and continues showing strong upward signs. The recent 3% rise over 24 hours brings ETH close to the $4,000 zone. What’s fueling this? A massive $1.59 billion in ETF inflows within a week, plus heightened interest from institutions. Following a low of $3,530 in late July, ETH has surged over 61% in the past month. The reduction in exchange balances, down more than 1 million ETH in 30 days, points to reduced sell pressure. Options traders are equally optimistic, with calls far outpacing puts and target ranges between $4,000 and $6,000. While it’s a strong performer, Ethereum’s maturity could limit fast gains. For those who want explosive growth potential rather than gradual returns, newer options like BlockDAG may currently offer better upside. Still, ETH retains its place among the top cryptos to buy today for reliability and long-term value. Polygon (MATIC / POL) MATIC is staying relevant in discussions about the top cryptos to buy today. With a trading price near $0.2166 and a modest 2.6% gain, Polygon remains in motion. A notable 141% jump in USDC transfers confirms its strong presence in stablecoin and scaling infrastructure. Polygon hasn’t made headlines this week, but its zkEVM development and continuing partnerships keep the momentum alive. Current trading volume stands around $280 million, and price charts show strong consolidation between $0.40 and $0.42, signaling potential breakout if metrics align. That said, while Polygon is steady, some might view newer presale-stage cryptos like BlockDAG as more attractive for short-term gains. MATIC remains part of the top cryptos to buy today, but buyers chasing higher ROI may look elsewhere. Avalanche (AVAX) AVAX has seen a strong 6% price jump in the last 24 hours, climbing to about $26.40 with daily trading volume over $1.1 billion. The push is largely linked to ETF rumors and the successful launch of the Octane upgrade, which cut C-Chain gas fees by 42.7% and enhanced performance. Avalanche is also prioritizing security and development. Octane Security, which is now active, brings AI-driven audits into the dev workflow, reducing bugs and deployment risks. This has made AVAX more attractive to builders. Meanwhile, derivatives markets show growing open interest, with $835 million currently locked in. Still, compared to BlockDAG’s early-stage price and live features, Avalanche might not deliver the same explosive ROI. While AVAX is dependable, those searching for top cryptos to buy today with higher upside potential may favor BDAG’s offering. Final Take! Choosing among the top cryptos to buy today depends on your appetite for stability versus speed. Ethereum continues to dominate headlines and institutional flows, Polygon offers scalable tech, and Avalanche is turning heads with its development stack. But BlockDAG combines key elements like adoption, working products, and one of the most appealing presale prices in the market. With batch 29 priced at $0.0016 until August 11th, and a 3,025% return window leading up to the $0.05 listing, the math is hard to ignore. Add in the “NO VESTING PASS,” and it’s clear why buyers are racing in. For anyone eyeing fast gains with an already active project, BlockDAG is shaping up as one of the top cryptos to buy today before the window narrows any further.

2025-08-03 06:00:06,49457458,1754200806,XRP Whales Are Buying This New Altcoin for Major Profits,"As XRP continues to show strength in both spot and futures markets, large holders appear to be hedging their bets by diversifying into a promising new altcoin. With institutional confidence returning and the U.S. regulatory climate turning more favorable, market participants are preparing for what could be another major rally. Early indicators point to a quiet accumulation phase—especially among crypto whales—focused on one emerging opportunity that’s quickly drawing attention. One of those projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has emerged as a clear standout. Its momentum is fueled by surging demand and early allocation phases that are closing faster than expected, signaling that whales aren’t waiting around for broader access. XRP Sees Renewed Momentum as Regulatory Fog Clears XRP has regained its footing after a turbulent year, with recent data showing a rise in both liquidity and trading volume. Whales in particular have resumed accumulation, suggesting renewed confidence in Ripple’s legal clarity and the potential for new financial products involving XRP. On the derivatives side, XRP perpetual futures have overtaken Solana on multiple exchanges—a key indicator of growing speculative interest. Spot prices have also surged in response to positive market sentiment tied to potential institutional partnerships and broader crypto-friendly U.S. policies. Analysts are watching for a decisive move above the $3.60 mark to confirm bullish continuation. While XRP attracts traders with strong fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where many early investors see explosive potential . With access windows closing rapidly, a growing number of whales are moving capital into the project before it reaches large-scale visibility. Momentum has grown to the point that allocation rounds are selling out faster than expected , leaving latecomers scrambling. This pattern of fast-paced participation resembles what was seen during the early surges of now-legendary tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s expanding community, fast-paced growth, and comparison to SHIBA INU’s early days make it a top candidate for high-yield speculation. According to multiple trend trackers, entry points available now are unlikely to last long— timing is critical . Whales Are Positioning Themselves Early With crypto markets heating up again, experienced players are combining stability bets like XRP with high-ROI bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This two-pronged strategy of risk-balanced investing is becoming increasingly common, particularly among large-scale holders looking to front-run retail inflows. Whale tracking wallets have shown that some of the same XRP addresses accumulating during the 2020–2021 cycle are now deploying capital into low-cap altcoins, signaling that the smart money is already positioning itself for the next breakout. Conclusion XRP’s resurgence amid a friendlier U.S. crypto climate is attracting both traders and long-term holders. However, it’s the parallel whale activity in MAGACOIN FINANCE that has drawn the most intrigue from market watchers. With entry phases closing rapidly and investor interest at all-time highs , this altcoin is shaping up to be a rare opportunity ahead of its full-scale debut.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $113,500 (-0.8%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $114,121 24-hour low $113,448 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 113,556 Price Prediction $ 133,640 (17.66%) Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.54% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 111,818 200-Day SMA $ 91,276 14-Day RSI 42.21 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin declines below $114K. Resistance for BTC is at $119,684 Support for BTC/USD is at $110,621 The BTC price analysis for 3 August confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price moved toward $113K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces selling pressure below $114K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced bearish pressure as it declined below $114K. Currently, buyers are triggering minor recovery rally, resulting in a consolidation around immediate Fib levels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $1.37 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $113,500, declining by over 0.89% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and trades at 43, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $114K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.45, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $119,684, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,376. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $110,621, beginning a bearish trend to $107,181. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as sellers triggered strong pressure toward $114K. The recent highs triggered strong selling demand among holders. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $812.25 million in net outflows on Friday, marking the second-largest single-day loss in the history of these products. Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,1,key takeaway bitcoin price face volatility around bitcoin price

2025-08-03 05:45:34,49457456,1754199934,Crypto Whales Just Flagged These 4 Best Meme Coins in 2025 for Potential Moonshots,"What do crypto whales, meme coin analysts, and savvy traders all have in common right now? They’re quietly accumulating positions in a fresh batch of meme coins that could dominate headlines in the coming months. With sentiment heating up, four projects have stood out as the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to rising social buzz, strong communities, and unique narratives. While some of these coins are already riding market momentum, one is still in its early whitelist phase, attracting serious attention for offering early access perks. Let’s dive into the four picks that crypto whales are watching for massive upside potential. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Whitelist-Only Access to the Bulls’ Den There’s one project that hasn’t launched yet, and that’s exactly why it’s getting flagged by insiders. MoonBull is quickly emerging as one of the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to its whitelist-only access model and intense buildup ahead of launch. This Ethereum-based meme coin was made for degens chasing breakout gains. But unlike other tokens flooding the market, MoonBull isn’t offering a public presale. Only whitelisted users can join the launch, and here’s what makes that a big deal: Lowest possible entry price for early adopters Secret staking rewards reserved only for whitelisted wallets Bonus token allocations that aren’t publicly disclosed Private roadmap hints available exclusively to early community members In short, the project is keeping its cards close, and that exclusivity is creating serious momentum. The idea? Get whitelisted or miss your shot. The signup process is simple: users drop their email into the secure whitelist form and get a private alert ahead of Stage One. Why This Coin Made the List MoonBull’s structure is tailor-made for big moves. With limited access, a capped supply, and early-stage excitement building, it’s no wonder that crypto whales have started circling early. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a ticket into a high-energy ecosystem that’s primed for an explosive start. 2. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): Solana’s Viral Tribute to a Fallen Hero Meme coins often reflect the culture of the moment, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a perfect example. Launched on the Solana blockchain, this token is a tribute to a real-life squirrel named Peanut, whose story captured the internet’s attention and sparked a viral movement. What makes PNUT stand out isn’t just its narrative, but how it’s turned emotional resonance into community action. The project channels public sentiment into something tangible: a meme coin that doubles as a symbol of animal advocacy. Its performance on Solana has been steady, and its meme appeal continues to pull in new supporters. Forums, TikTok, and X have been keeping PNUT alive in the conversation as the broader market eyes new narratives. Why did this coin make it to this list? PNUT combines a powerful backstory with a growing user base, making it one of the best meme coins in 2025 for emotional engagement and long-term potential. 3. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): A Gospel of Memes and AI on Solana Next up is Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), a Solana meme coin that’s turning heads with its hilarious and chaotic “Goat Gospel” theme. Powered by a custom AI bot known as the Truth Terminal, GOAT delivers a daily dose of internet chaos, humor, and meme prophecy. This project leans fully into meme culture, embracing randomness and absurdity as a virtue. It doesn’t pretend to have traditional utility, its entire value proposition is entertainment, virality, and the strength of its community. GOAT has built a devoted cult following, and its unique approach is keeping it relevant in a sea of meme clones. Why did this coin make it to this list? GOAT is one of the best meme coins in 2025 for its commitment to pure meme energy and viral AI-generated storytelling, a combo that’s clearly working. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Cult Classic With Pink Hat Power Dogwifhat (WIF) might sound silly at first, and that’s exactly the point. Born from a Shiba Inu wearing a pink hat, WIF has grown into a cultural icon on Solana. It doesn’t offer staking or burning mechanisms, and it doesn’t claim to solve complex problems. What it does offer is a passionate community and consistent attention on social platforms. WIF has proven that even simple concepts can lead to big runs, as long as the community stays active and the memes keep flowing. It’s been one of Solana’s standout meme coins, and it’s still getting volume. Why did this coin make it to this list? WIF earns its spot among the best meme coins in 2025 by showing how meme strength and community loyalty can build lasting relevance without needing utility. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the best meme coins in 2025 are MoonBull , Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), and Dogwifhat (WIF). While each has its own distinct personality, one stands out for offering early access perks that no other project can match. MoonBull is still in its whitelist phase, and that makes it uniquely positioned for high potential gains. With exclusive benefits, limited spots, and a stealth-mode rollout, MoonBull offers the kind of opportunity traders dream of, but only if they act fast. The clock’s ticking. The bulls are charging. Will you be there when MoonBull lifts off? For More Information: Website : https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram : https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter : https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What makes MoonBull different from other meme coins? MoonBull offers whitelist-only access, meaning early users get in at the lowest price with exclusive staking rewards and bonus tokens before the public ever sees it. Why are analysts watching these meme coins in 2025? These coins combine strong community support, narrative appeal, and bullish momentum, three key ingredients analysts consider for potential moonshots. How can I join the MoonBull whitelist?

2025-08-03 05:33:52,49457380,1754199232,What Next For XRP as $2.75 Level Holds After Sharp Decline From $3,"XRP plunged nearly 9% in the 24-hour session ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), falling from $3.02 to as low as $2.75 before staging a mild recovery to $2.82. The decline was driven by heightened institutional selling pressure, with volumes during the heaviest selling window more than doubling the daily average. Price action suggests potential exhaustion near $2.75, though broader macro and liquidity risks remain elevated. What to Know XRP saw peak sell pressure between 14:00–18:00 on August 2, with volumes reaching 222.24 million—183% higher than the 24-hour average of 78.52 million. The asset bottomed at $2.75, forming short-term support on heavy volume. Recovery attempts stalled at $2.84, with the final hour of trading closing at $2.82, indicating consolidation below key resistance. Volume-weighted price activity suggests accumulation interest at sub-$2.80 levels, but confirmation is lacking. News Background The XRP drawdown came amid widening global trade tensions and renewed tariff uncertainty that shook risk markets across the board. Meanwhile, institutional portfolios appeared to rebalance as macro conditions prompted capital rotation away from altcoins and into more liquid assets. Analysts point to ongoing adjustments by central banks and heightened geopolitical risk as catalysts for the broader sell-off. Price Action Summary High: $3.02 Low: $2.75 Close: $2.82 24H Range: $0.27 (-8.91%) Technical Analysis A volume climax at $2.75 coincided with XRP’s most aggressive hourly decline, typically a signal of capitulation or local bottoming. The $2.75–$2.76 zone now serves as first-layer support, while upside attempts are capped near $2.84. Volume fell sharply in the final hour of trading to ~650,000/min, compared to 3.7 million/min at peak, implying buyer fatigue or neutral flows post-dump. What Traders Are Watching Can XRP hold above $2.75–$2.76 and build a base for recovery, or does failure to reclaim $2.85+ indicate further downside? Watch for institutional inflows or continued exchange outflows, which may validate accumulation narratives. Traders are also closely tracking CD20 Index volatility and macro headlines, including U.S.-China trade developments, for short-term cues.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,xrp plunged nearly session ending august falling low staging mild recovery decline driven heightened institutional selling pressure volume heaviest selling window doubling daily average price action suggests potential exhaustion near though broader macro liquidity risk remain elevated know xrp saw peak sell pressure august volume reaching higher average million asset bottomed forming support heavy volume recovery attempt stalled final hour trading closing indicating consolidation key resistance price activity suggests accumulation interest level confirmation lacking news background xrp drawdown came amid widening global trade tension renewed tariff uncertainty shook risk market across board meanwhile institutional portfolio appeared rebalance macro condition prompted capital rotation away altcoins liquid asset analyst point ongoing adjustment central bank heightened geopolitical risk catalyst broader price action summary high low close range technical analysis volume climax coincided xrp aggressive hourly decline typically signal capitulation local bottoming zone serf support upside attempt capped near volume fell sharply final hour trading compared peak implying buyer fatigue neutral flow trader watching xrp hold build base recovery failure reclaim indicate downside watch institutional inflow continued exchange outflow may validate accumulation narrative trader also closely tracking index volatility macro headline including trade development cue,0.181,0.7,0.119,-0.8074,0

2025-08-03 05:30:16,49457454,1754199016,Shiba Inu Coin’s utility and community strength continue to grow with the launch of DLMining’s SHIB-focused contracts,"DLMining announced today the official launch of its short-term contracts for Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), one of the most community-driven digital assets on the market. This new product allows everyday users to participate in SHIB-linked rewards programs designed to shorten tenures and increase returns—especially as SHIB’s utility and adoption continue to expand globally. This development comes amid growing interest in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which has evolved from its initial meme coin into a broader decentralized platform with its own Layer 2 blockchain, NFT projects, and expanding payment integrations. By offering structured contracts centered around SHIB, DLMining aims to provide users with easier access to one of the most sought-after and accessible digital assets on the market. Learn more about Shiba Inu Coin Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, Shiba Inu Coin is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB has evolved from its humble beginnings as a meme coin into a decentralized ecosystem supported by a large and active community, the ShibArmy. SHIB consistently ranks among the highest-valued cryptocurrencies, with millions of holders worldwide. With this continued interest, DLMining ‘s newly launched SHIB-based contracts aim to provide users with a simplified way to participate in the asset’s short-term potential without having to navigate a complex trading environment. Broader Ecosystem Shiba Inu now forms the foundation of a broader ecosystem, including: LEASH: Originally a rebase token, LEASH has been repositioned as a store of value within the Shiba ecosystem. Its limited supply of 107,646 tokens has attracted significant investor interest. ShibaSwap: Launched in 2021, ShibaSwap allows users to stake SHIB, redeem it for cryptocurrencies, and earn passive rewards, helping to differentiate SHIB from other meme tokens. Shibarium: The team launched Shibarium in 2023, a Layer 2 blockchain designed to reduce gas fees and increase transaction speeds. The platform currently supports a growing number of DApps, NFTs, and DeFi integrations, enhancing the overall utility of SHIB. With these developments, SHIB’s use cases continue to expand. Platforms like DLMining are building this ecosystem by enabling contract-based participation that is closely tied to SHIB’s evolving role. Market Overview – July 2025 As of the end of July 2025, key SHIB metrics include: Price: $0.00001875 Market Cap: ~$7.5 billion 24-hour Trading Volume: ~$1.14 trillion Total Supply: 1 quadrillion (a significant portion has been burned) Market momentum remains stable in 2025, thanks to SHIB’s comprehensive coverage across major exchanges, wallet integrations, and POS platforms. The ecosystem’s expanding functionality, particularly related to Shibarium, supports long-term investor confidence. DLMining’s products for SHIB reflect this stability and offer users an option to gain investment opportunities over a shorter timeframe through structured contracts. Real-World Usage and Payment Integrations SHIB’s adoption as a payment method has significantly increased. Through integrations with platforms like BitPay, NOWPayments, and Shopping.io, SHIB is now accepted by a growing number of online merchants, retailers, and service providers, including those in the travel industry. This expansion highlights SHIB’s transformation from a speculative asset to a viable medium of exchange. This real-world utility has created a broader user base for SHIB—something DLMining seeks to support by making SHIB-related digital contracts accessible through mobile platforms. Development Roadmap and Future Initiatives Shibarium outlined several upcoming developments designed to enhance the ecosystem: SHIB: Metaverse: A virtual environment that allows users to build, trade, and socialize using SHIB tokens. NFT Expansion: Continued support for Shiboshis, SHIB’s NFT collection, and integration with the broader metaverse. Shibarium Growth: Onboarding more third-party DApps and projects. Token Burning: Ongoing deflationary mechanisms for SHIB, LEASH, and BONE tokens. The ecosystem’s evolution also informs the creation of new utility-focused products, such as DLMining’s short-term SHIB contracts, which allow users to explore SHIB’s growth potential without requiring deep technical knowledge. Participate through DLMining In line with SHIB’s growing influence, DLMining’s new SHIB-exclusive contracts are designed to facilitate limited-time participation in SHIB’s market dynamics. Building on the success of similar products based on Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin, these contracts aim to provide users with short-term investment opportunities with potential returns based on market trends. New users receive a $15 bonus upon registration. Continued Interest in SHIB in 2025 Investors continue to show interest in SHIB for the following reasons: Low Barrier to Entry: SHIB’s low price makes it accessible to a wide range of investors.

These two coins offer solid fundamentals but continue to fall short in terms of active performance. The Cardano (ADA) price prediction shows potential gains through August, while the Render (RNDR) chart displays a setup that looks close to breaking out. However, as traders hold off for bigger price moves, many are choosing a faster way to use their crypto, with real-time returns. That’s exactly where Spartans.com comes in. It ranks among the best crypto gaming platforms, designed for people who prefer action over waiting. ADA holders are using their coins on Spartans to unlock 300% welcome bonuses, access a massive library of over 5,963 games, and place bets on everything from basketball to MMA. With rapid crypto payouts and regular daily offers, Spartans has become a more engaging use for coins that would otherwise sit idle. This piece explores why more users are making the switch from passive waiting to active play. How Spartans Turns Idle ADA Into Nonstop Action Many ADA users are beginning to notice the downside of simply letting their crypto stay unused. Since price rallies often take time, people are now engaging with Spartans to turn ADA into real-time rewards. Spartans allows users to deposit ADA and receive a 300% bonus instantly, with a vast gaming selection and same-day withdrawals. Whether it’s slots, card tables, or UFC bets, there’s always something happening. Unlike other platforms, Spartans is tailored specifically for crypto users. Top wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet are supported for quick deposits, and users don’t have to deal with long wait times or ID checks when withdrawing. You can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, USDC, Avalanche, and ADA on both the casino and sportsbook sections, easily switching between them. What separates Spartans from the usual names in crypto casinos is how it adds genuine entertainment and payout potential. There’s a wide range of high-risk slots, live dealer shows, and even crash-style games. For sports fans, Spartans includes everything from major leagues like the NBA and EPL to tennis and eSports, featuring real-time stats, odds, and quick betting slips. With frequent promotions and generous new player rewards, the platform constantly offers fresh ways to win. There’s even a Lamborghini reward program for active users. For those holding ADA and tired of waiting on slow market shifts, Spartans offers a fast-paced and rewarding alternative. ADA Forecast: Is a Move Above $1 Within Reach? Cardano (ADA) looks set to build gradual strength into August. Its current price of $0.82 is holding firm above a key $0.76 support level. If this trend holds, technical charts suggest a possible rise to between $0.90 and $1.05. With broader bullish momentum, some forecasts even stretch as high as $1.30 by Q3’s end. Another factor drawing attention is whale accumulation, as on-chain data reveals a steady rise in large ADA holdings. The upcoming Hydra/Leios upgrade could serve as another boost in the latter half of 2025. Yet, while some are still holding out for a breakout, others are already putting ADA to use through Spartans, taking advantage of fast rewards instead of sitting through market delays. RNDR Charts Show Coiled Momentum Ahead of a Key Breakout Render (RNDR) remains in a tight price window, fluctuating between $4.00 and $5.50. Current prices hover around $4.27, and while volume has dropped, momentum indicators like RSI and moving averages show the coin still has energy for a potential move. Projections for August place RNDR between $5.24 and $5.89, with more bullish targets aiming at $8 if the trend recovers. So far, RNDR has remained just under the critical $5.50 mark. If it breaks through, stronger gains could follow, though slipping below $4.00 may open the door for a fall to $3.60 or lower. While traders monitor this closely, others are already using RNDR on Spartans to win in real time while waiting for the charts to shift. Final Say While ADA looks to cross $1 and RNDR eyes $5.50, both remain in buildup mode. Meanwhile, a growing number of users are taking a different approach, activating their crypto through Spartans. This isn’t just another casino; it’s a crypto-powered gaming and sports betting hub offering 300% welcome bonuses, 5,963+ games, and instant cash-outs. Rather than passively watching the market, users are making their crypto work for them through Spartans. Whether it’s securing a big win on slots or placing live sports bets, the platform provides entertainment and tangible returns. For anyone ready to stop waiting and start using their crypto, Spartans stands out as the smarter route.

2025-08-02 19:00:33,49438957,1754161233,"Missed Cardano (ADA)? Experts Say Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is the Smartest Move Now as CoinMarketCap Listing Boost Sales To 210M Tokens, Early Rally Signs?","For investors reminiscing on Cardano’s (ADA) meteoric rise, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is shaping up to be the next big opportunity. Since its CoinMarketCap (CMC) debut , Ruvi AI has been on a financial tear, selling over 210 million tokens in its presale phase. With nearly 1 million tokens sold daily and Phase 2 nearing its end, investors are picking up on early rally signals that could drive Ruvi AI into the stratosphere. But what separates Ruvi AI from the pack, and why are experts calling it the smartest move in crypto right now? Read on to learn how this token’s audited security, AI-driven technology, and immense growth potential make it a promising contender to mimic the legacy of Cardano. The CoinMarketCap Effect, Why Visibility Matters CoinMarketCap’s listing is seen as a gold standard for crypto projects, indicating credibility and trustworthiness to potential investors. For Ruvi AI, the CMC debut has been nothing short of transformational. The listing catapulted its visibility across global markets , allowing Ruvi AI to secure its spot on both retail and institutional investor radars overnight. The Numbers Don’t Lie Here’s a snapshot of Ruvi AI’s presale momentum: 70% of Phase 2 Sold: Over 210 million tokens claimed by early enthusiasts. $2.6 Million Raised: A testament to high investor confidence.

2025-08-02 19:00:14,49435737,1754161214,Satoshimeter Shows Where Bitcoin Price Is In This Cycle,"The Bitcoin price surge above $120,000 has reignited speculation about where the flagship cryptocurrency stands in the current cycle. While price action alone offers only part of the picture, on-chain data from the Satoshimeter indicator suggests that Bitcoin is still firmly in the mid-phase of its cycle, pointing to significant potential ahead in its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Price Still In Mid-Cycle Stage Bitcoin’s climb from $100,000 to a new ATH above $123,000 has brought fresh attention to on-chain metrics used to identify the cryptocurrency’s current stage in the present market cycle. Among them, the Satoshimeter, an indicator developed by crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizard, offers a nuanced look into Bitcoin’s movements and price position. Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert According to the expert’s analysis released on X social media, the Satoshimeter signaled that Bitcoin is still far from the euphoric peak zones observed in previous bull markets. Stockmoney Lizard also claimed that Bitcoin’s rally is in its mid-cycle or intermediate phase rather than the final leg of the bull cycle. Supporting this analysis, the Satoshimeter employs on-chain metrics to map out Bitcoin’s cyclical behavior, identifying both long-term bottoms and tops. Historically, this indicator’s readings around 1.6 have typically marked major bear market bottoms, as seen in the price chart in the years 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2022. Higher values, on the other hand, previously aligned with cycle peaks and often signaled sharp corrections. As of now, the Satoshimeter is still well below the upper extremes, signaling that the Bitcoin price is not yet in the overheated zone. The analyst’s chart illustrates this trend clearly. Each past market top is marked by a steep spike in the indicator, aligning with parabolic price action and extreme sentiment. In contrast, current indicator readings are elevated but stable, sitting in the mid-range, well below levels seen at past cycle tops. This suggests that Bitcoin’s broader bullish structure remains intact, with potential for further upside on the table. Bitcoin To Reach $200,000 This Cycle? Based on the Satoshimeter’s current level, Stockmoney Lizards projects an extended run in the Bitcoin price. While the recent jump above $123,000 reflects growing momentum, the analyst anticipates a stair-step progression toward a potential high of $200,000 before a significant market correction sets in. Related Reading: Crypto Disaster: Qubetics Token Crashes Nearly 100%—Possible Rug Pull This projection is based not only on the readings from the Satoshimeter indicator but also on the movements seen in prior cycles, where BTC typically moved through multiple phases of accumulation, breakout, and parabolic growth. As of writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $113,759, reflecting an 8.3% decline from its all-time high. With $200,000 set as its next peak target, this implies a potential rally of more than 75% in the current cycle.

2025-08-02 19:00:10,49435759,1754161210,Josip Heit and Apertum win major lawsuit against Texas State Securities Board in landmark victory for DeFi,"The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) has formally dropped its case against the Apertum Foundation and its senior advisor, Josip Heit, a move that could shape the future of cryptocurrency litigation. Notably, the decision ends claims that Apertum’s DAO1 platform and APTM token were unregistered securities, while affirming they do not qualify as investment contracts under U.S. law. Represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, the Apertum Foundation successfully argued that its platform operates outside the scope of traditional securities regulations. Legal observers view the dismissal as a landmark moment, at a time when the regulatory landscape is increasingly open to blockchain technology driven by the policy shifts under the Donald Trump administration. Reaction to Apertum case dismissal Heit has consistently maintained that Apertum was both compliant and secure, framing the case as a test of regulatory boundaries. He therefore welcomed the dismissal as a validation of the platform and a step toward clearer legal frameworks for blockchain technology . “From Day One, the Apertum Foundation has offered a compliant, safe platform and cutting-edge technology. We promised to defend ourselves aggressively against the Texas Securities Board’s mistaken allegations, and we have now been vindicated. This dismissal confirms we did nothing wrong,” Heit said in a press statement shared with Finbold on August 2. On the other hand, Avi Perry, of Quinn Emanuel, said the case was unfounded, praised the firm’s legal effort, and acknowledged the TSSB for reversing its position. Apertum wins major lawsuit against Texas State Securities Board in landmark victory for DeFi With the legal development, the case not only removes uncertainty for Apertum but also sets a precedent for other DeFi platforms seeking clarity from U.S. authorities. Meanwhile, as the crypto industry continues to mature, the ruling may help define the contours of future regulatory oversight. This is specifically vital considering the United States is making progress toward a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Featured image via Flickr (public domain).

2025-08-02 19:00:00,49436846,1754161200,LTC may hit $300 while a next-gen payments altcoin shows 10x wallet growth in Q3,"Litecoin price is showing renewed bullish momentum, supported by strong institutional interest and promising technical setups, even as attention shifts toward next-gen altcoins powering the future of decentralized payments. With a 10x wallet growth and a game-changing beta launch on the horizon, analysts say this high growth crypto is emerging as the top crypto investment to watch in Q3 and will complement Litecoin in bringing accessible finance to underserved areas. Litecoin price eyes $300 amid whale accumulation LTC is trading around $105, consolidating above key support after bouncing from $100. Litecoin analysts now point to $120 as the next breakout level for Litecoin’s price, with bullish sentiment building toward the $300 target. Whale wallets added over 2 million LTC in July, signaling rising institutional confidence. The inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and key Fibonacci resistance at $132 could set the stage for a breakout rally. Litecoin’s appeal as “digital silver” continues to grow, especially as delays around ETF approval for top L1s shift focus to altcoins with proven liquidity and strong fundamentals. With faster speeds and lower fees than BTC, LTC remains a core institutional asset. Litecoin price predictions for late 2025 range from $199 to $280, with some analysts citing up to $670 if LTC momentum continues. Remittix: the PayFi altcoin exploding ahead of September launch While Litecoin benefits from institutional backing, Remittix (RTX) is stealing the spotlight as the top-performing early-stage crypto of 2025. Remittix has seen over 500 million tokens sold during its fundraising, achieving over 10x wallet growth ahead of its September 15 beta launch. Unlike Litecoin, which serves as a store of value, Remittix is solving real-world cross-border payment challenges, targeting the $190 trillion remittance market with direct crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries. Why Remittix is smart money’s next play Explosive wallet growth point to standout user adoption. Beta Launch Confirmed: Set for September 15, with crypto-ready APIs. Built for Business: Offers enterprise-grade tools for crypto payments with real-time fiat settlements. Security First: CertiK-audited with zero critical issues, cementing investor trust. Deflationary Model: Every transaction reduces supply, boosting long-term value. The top ICO’s multi-chain architecture, support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat pairs, and CertiK-audited security make it one of the most utility-driven tokens in the market. $250,000 giveaway powers massive user surge To build momentum ahead of its beta, Remittix is giving away $250,000 to steadfast holders , fueling a 380% spike in wallet signups. With the Defi company ready to process over $300 million in cross-border volume daily, investors are seeing a rare chance to get in early. For asset managers, Litecoin price is eyeing a 3x climb to $300, through slow, steady gains while Remittix offers the kind of exponential growth that defines the next generation of top crypto investments.

2025-08-02 18:55:10,49435575,1754160910,Crypto Futures Liquidation: The Shockwave That Wiped Out $601 Million,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: The Shockwave That Wiped Out $601 Million The world of cryptocurrency is known for its rapid movements and significant volatility. Recently, the market experienced a stark reminder of this reality when a staggering sum of money was wiped out in a short period. In just one hour, major exchanges witnessed $116 million worth of futures contracts liquidated, a figure that escalated to $601 million over a 24-hour span. These numbers, while startling, are not just statistics; they represent real financial impacts on traders and signal crucial insights into market dynamics. Understanding what drives such massive instances of crypto futures liquidation is essential for anyone navigating this complex landscape. What Exactly Is Crypto Futures Liquidation? To grasp the gravity of recent events, it is important to understand what crypto futures liquidation entails. In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin—the collateral they put up to open the position—falls below a certain threshold required to keep the trade open. When market prices move significantly against a leveraged position, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for the trader and itself. Leverage: This is the core concept behind futures trading. It allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, 10x leverage means you can trade with $10,000 worth of crypto by only putting up $1,000 of your own money. Margin: The actual capital a trader commits to open and maintain a leveraged position. It acts as collateral. Margin Call: While less common in automated crypto futures, conceptually, this is a warning that your margin is running low. Liquidation often happens automatically once the margin falls below the maintenance level. Maintenance Margin: The minimum amount of equity required in a trading account to hold a futures position. If the equity drops below this level, liquidation is triggered. Why Do Such Large Crypto Futures Liquidations Occur? The recent liquidation event, particularly the $116 million in an hour, is a direct consequence of several interconnected factors inherent to the crypto market. Understanding these drivers is key to anticipating and managing risk. Here are the primary reasons behind these significant liquidation cascades: High Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Sudden, sharp price movements, whether up or down, can quickly push leveraged positions into unprofitable territory. A large, unexpected price swing can wipe out the margin of numerous traders simultaneously. Excessive Leverage: Many traders in the crypto futures market use very high leverage, sometimes up to 100x or even higher. While this amplifies potential gains, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Even a small price movement against a highly leveraged position can lead to a total loss of the margin. Stop-Loss Hunting and Cascading Effects: Large market players or ‘whales’ can sometimes intentionally or unintentionally trigger a cascade. When a significant price move begins, it can trigger the stop-loss orders of many traders. As these positions are closed, it adds selling (or buying) pressure, further moving the price, which then triggers more stop-losses and liquidations, creating a domino effect. This phenomenon is often referred to as a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘liquidation spiral’. Market News and Events: Macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, or even major project updates can cause swift market reactions. If such news is negative and unexpected, it can lead to rapid sell-offs and, consequently, mass liquidations for long positions. A Closer Look at the $116 Million Crypto Futures Liquidation The reported $116 million worth of futures liquidated in a single hour and the broader $601 million over 24 hours highlight the intensity of recent market movements. These figures represent the total value of the positions that were forcibly closed. When such large amounts are liquidated, it suggests a sudden, significant price change that caught many leveraged traders off guard. Consider the scale of these events: Timeframe Approximate Liquidation Amount Implied Market Impact Past Hour $116 Million Sudden, Sharp Price Movement Past 24 Hours $601 Million Sustained Volatility & Pressure These numbers indicate that a substantial number of traders, likely those with high leverage, found their positions underwater very quickly. This often happens during unexpected market reversals or accelerated trends, where the market does not provide enough time for manual intervention or for lower-leveraged positions to withstand the pressure. Who Is Most Vulnerable to Crypto Futures Liquidation? While anyone trading with leverage faces the risk of liquidation, certain groups tend to be more susceptible. Retail traders, often drawn by the promise of amplified gains, sometimes overleverage their positions without fully understanding the risks. They might not have the sophisticated risk management tools or deep capital reserves that institutional traders possess. However, even institutional players can face liquidations if their risk models fail to account for extreme market conditions or ‘black swan’ events. The sheer volume of recent liquidations suggests that a broad spectrum of traders, from individual speculators to larger funds, felt the impact of the market’s recent movements. What Is the Broader Market Impact of Mass Liquidations? Large-scale crypto futures liquidation events do not happen in a vacuum; they send ripples throughout the entire crypto ecosystem. Their impact can be felt in several ways: Increased Volatility: As positions are closed, it can create further selling or buying pressure, exacerbating price swings. This can lead to a cycle where more liquidations occur, fueling further volatility. Market Sentiment: Significant liquidation events can dent investor confidence. Seeing large sums wiped out can lead to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), causing some traders to reduce their exposure or exit the market altogether. Funding Rates: Futures contracts often have ‘funding rates’ that traders pay or receive to keep their positions open. During periods of extreme liquidations, these funding rates can become highly skewed, indicating strong directional bias in the market. Exchange Stability: While exchanges are designed to handle liquidations, extremely rapid and large-scale events can test their systems. Robust liquidation engines are crucial for maintaining market order. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Traders Given the inherent risks, how can traders better navigate the treacherous waters of crypto futures trading and mitigate the risk of crypto futures liquidation? Here are some actionable insights: Understand Leverage Thoroughly: Do not use leverage blindly. Calculate the exact liquidation price for your position at different leverage levels. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required for liquidation. Implement Strict Risk Management: Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predetermined point. This limits potential losses. Position Sizing: Never allocate a large percentage of your portfolio to a single highly leveraged trade. Determine a comfortable percentage of your total capital you are willing to risk on any single trade. Diversify: While futures trading often focuses on one asset, consider your overall portfolio. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Monitor Funding Rates and Open Interest: These metrics can provide clues about market sentiment and potential areas of congestion where liquidations might occur. High open interest in a specific direction with extreme funding rates can signal a crowded trade vulnerable to reversal. Stay Informed and Adapt: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data. The crypto market evolves quickly, and adapting your strategy based on current conditions is vital. Start Small: If you are new to futures trading, begin with very small positions and low leverage. Gain experience and confidence before increasing your exposure. Challenges and Risks Associated with Futures Trading While futures trading offers the potential for significant profits due to leverage, it comes with substantial challenges and risks. The primary challenge is managing the amplified risk. A small miscalculation or an unexpected market move can lead to rapid and complete loss of capital. The emotional toll of trading, especially during volatile periods, can also be immense, leading to impulsive decisions that further exacerbate losses. Furthermore, the 24/7 nature of crypto markets means constant vigilance is often required, which can be mentally exhausting. The complexity of understanding various order types, margin requirements, and funding rates also presents a barrier to entry for many new traders. The Future of Crypto Futures Liquidation As the crypto market matures, exchanges are continually refining their liquidation engines and risk management protocols. However, as long as leverage exists, so will the risk of crypto futures liquidation. Regulatory oversight may also play a role in shaping how futures products are offered and used, potentially leading to stricter leverage limits in some jurisdictions. Ultimately, education and responsible trading practices will remain the most powerful tools for individual traders to navigate these inherent market forces. In conclusion, the recent $116 million in an hour and $601 million in 24 hours of crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and amplified risks within leveraged cryptocurrency trading. These events are not random occurrences but are driven by high leverage, sudden price movements, and cascading effects. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, understanding the mechanics of liquidation and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount. For traders, the key lies in informed decision-making, disciplined execution, and a healthy respect for the market’s unpredictable nature. Staying educated and practicing caution will be your best allies in this dynamic financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto futures liquidation?

A3: Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, properly sizing their positions relative to their total capital, diversifying their investments, and continuously educating themselves on market dynamics and risk management principles. Q4: Does crypto futures liquidation affect the broader cryptocurrency market? A4: Yes, large liquidation events can significantly impact the broader market. They often lead to increased price volatility, can negatively affect market sentiment, and may influence funding rates, creating a ripple effect across the ecosystem. Q5: Is crypto futures trading inherently risky? A5: Yes, crypto futures trading is inherently risky due to the use of leverage, which amplifies both potential gains and losses.

In its last major rally, XRP surged more than 13x in five years, turning modest investments into fortunes. With XRP showing signs of recovery but already a top-3 token, traders are looking for the next high-upside opportunity. One crypto analyst may have just found it, and it’s still under $0.002. That token is Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , a meme coin-turned-ecosystem project catching serious attention for its unique angle and explosive potential. Why Traders Are Comparing Little Pepe (LILPEPE) to Early XRP XRP delivered massive returns because it solved a real problem, cross-border transactions, and had institutional ambition. Though lighter in tone, Little Pepe is carving out a similar disruptive lane: a Layer-2 blockchain built just for memes, complete with lightning speed, ultra-low fees, and anti-sniper bot technology. Here’s what traders are zeroing in on: Massive upside at micro-cap entry: $LILPEPE is still in presale with a market cap well below $300 million. Layer-2 innovation: First meme-centric Ethereum-compatible chain with faster speeds and dirt-cheap transactions. Anti-sniper tech: A chain where bots can’t exploit early buyers, a first in crypto, and a huge selling point. Launchpad for future meme coins: Just as XRP provided rails for fintech, Little Pepe offers rails for the meme economy. Backed by meme experts who helped steer other viral coins to success. With over $13 million raised and 9.3 billion tokens sold, the project is already drawing deep liquidity and attention before launch, much like early XRP. Presale Momentum Soars as Price Up 70% From Start Little Pepe’s presale has been moving at a blistering pace. Since launching on June 10, it has sold out seven stages and is 91% through Stage 8, with tokens currently priced at $0.0017. That’s a 70% increase from the original price of $0.001 in Stage 1. Once Stage 9 goes live, the price is expected to rise again. The presale ends at a listing price of $0.003, meaning investors getting in now are still early, but not for long. The project has also completed its smart contract audit, boosting credibility among serious traders and increasing confidence that this isn’t another rug pull. Combined with a live CoinMarketCap listing , Little Pepe is already visible and verifiable, something few meme projects can claim before launch. Could $1,000 Turn Into $100,000? Let’s talk numbers. If LILPEPE pulls an XRP-like surge, similar to a 100x or 500x rally, which XRP did in past cycles, here’s what that looks like: $1,000 at $0.0017 becomes: $100,000 at $0.17 (approx. 59x) $170,000 at $0.29 (100x) $510,000 at $0.51 (300x+) That may sound bold, but consider the catalysts: Listings on 2 Top CEXs at launch A roadmap targeting the biggest exchange in the world Ongoing $777,000 giveaway to fuel presale interest and community engagement Built-in utility from Launchpad, L2 ecosystem, anti-bot architecture A strong vesting schedule to prevent dumping and maintain price stability ( view vesting ) In today’s meme economy, going viral isn’t just about memes but mechanisms. And Little Pepe seems to have both. How to Buy Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Buying LILPEPE early gives you access to the lowest price point before launch. Here’s how to get started: Visit the official presale site: littlepepe.com Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet recommended). Buy using ETH, USDT, or BNB. Track your holdings via the dashboard. Once the token launches, you can claim your LILPEPE directly from the same dashboard. Bonus: All presale buyers are automatically enrolled in the $777K giveaway , where 10 winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. Final Thoughts: Could This Be the Next Ripple Moment? XRP showed what can happen when utility meets timing and belief. Today, Little Pepe is shaping to be more than a meme, a movement built on early access, community innovation, and fresh tech. With the macro setup favoring altcoins, the meme narrative alive, and Trump’s rate cut talk pushing traders toward higher-risk, higher-reward bets, LILPEPE may be the token that turns $1,000 into life-changing returns. Presale is nearly over. Track or buy at littlepepe.com before Stage 8 closes.

In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says that the current market cap of Microsoft (MSFT) will soar by more than $1.1 trillion by the end of next year, after the company’s latest earnings came in this week. “We think Microsoft’s going to be a $5 trillion market cap in 2026 … when I look at what [Microsoft CEO Satya] Nadella is doing in terms of the cloud strategy, those are [cloud computing platform] Azure numbers that were beyond bull case… When you think about the big tech growth story in the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution, this is just the next phase of growth that’s now going to the second, third, fourth derivative.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.896 trillion and is trading for $524 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.23 trillion. Next up, Ives warns that while Apple’s earnings this week showed promise, the company is falling behind when it comes to AI. “Right now, [Apple’s] essentially on a park bench drinking lemonade, watching the AI revolution go forward… It was a robust quarter. I mean, you look at the demand bounce back that we saw in China, 4% growth… But the elephant in the room is AI… Investors want to see them now change the status quo.” Meanwhile, Ives believes Amazon’s profits will continue to increase. “If you look at AWS (Amazon Web Services), strong. You look at ultimately guidance, I mean guidance from a top-line perspective, I believe it’s pretty robust. I actually believe this is sort of the renaissance of growth that’s about to happen at Amazon.” Apple has a market cap of $3.02 trillion and is trading for $202 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading for $214 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $2.28 trillion.

According to Lee, this step could herald a new era for Ethereum (ETH). Tom Lee noted that Ethereum has been performing strongly against Bitcoin since April, with the ETH/BTC ratio steadily rising. He argued that Wall Street's interest in Ethereum is behind this move. According to Lee, the development of stablecoins on Ethereum has become a “ChatGPT moment” for the blockchain. Lee stated that the “Project Crypto” initiative, jointly announced by the SEC and the White House, aims to solidify the US's global leadership by moving financial markets onto the chain. “This means stepping into the golden age of finance,” Lee said, noting that Ethereum is the blockchain with the largest smart contract infrastructure. Related News: Company Known as Ethereum's MicroStrategy Purchased Another Large Amount of ETH Today Also Ethereum: It is the largest smart contract network and the most compliant with US regulations, It has never experienced an interruption since its establishment, JPMorgan said that giants like Robinhood prefer ETH in their tokenization processes. In the short term, Lee expects the ETH/BTC ratio to return to last year's levels (around 0.0500). In this scenario, Ethereum's price could rise to $5,707 in an environment where Bitcoin is trading at $114,000. According to the Fundstrat digital asset team, ETH is predicted to reach a fair value of between $10,000 and $20,000 in the next 12 months. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-02 18:30:26,49434533,1754159426,Top Crypto Proponent Says August & September Will Be Massively Bullish for XRP Holders. Here’s why,"In response to Jim Cramer’s latest remark: “I always despise both August and September… just tough months to make money”, crypto influencer Amelie fired back with conviction: “WE ARE SO BACK — AUGUST & SEPTEMBER WILL BE BULLISH AF FOR XRP HOLDERS.” Her post, which quickly gained traction, is more than just hype. It reflects a growing belief among analysts and investors that XRP is poised for a major rally over the coming weeks. Cramer’s Comment Spurs Contrarian Optimism Cramer’s comment, while seemingly negative, is being interpreted as a classic contrarian indicator. Traders have long joked that doing the opposite of his public calls often yields better results. In that light, Amelie’s excitement suggests the market could be setting up for a breakout, especially for XRP. WE ARE SO BACK AUGUST & SEPTEMBER WILL BE BULLISH AF FOR #XRP HOLDERS pic.twitter.com/NA1YJznwvz — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) August 2, 2025 XRP Technical Outlook: Signs of a Breakout After peaking at $3.66 on July 18, XRP saw a pullback to around $2.89 by late July. This 16% correction appeared to signal weakness, but under the surface, analysts noticed bullish divergence—a signal that sellers are losing steam and a reversal may be forming. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.85. Analysts point to the $3.03–$3.10 range as a critical resistance zone. A strong daily close above this level could trigger a breakout toward $3.50 and beyond. Some projections suggest a surge to $4.00 or even $5.00 could be achieved in the short term if momentum holds. Bullish Forecasts from Analysts Crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino recently predicted a 333% surge in XRP’s price, potentially pushing it to $13 within 40 days. His projection is based on a classic Elliott Wave triangle breakout, supported by long-term accumulation and reduced volatility. Peter Brandt, another respected voice in technical analysis, sees potential for a 60% rally, targeting $4.47. Meanwhile, Bitget’s research team forecasts XRP hitting $5 by year-end, citing institutional adoption and expanding real-world use cases in cross-border payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other outlets, including Analytics Insight and Finance Magnates, anticipate that XRP could reach between $8 and $9 by mid-September under sustained bullish conditions and favorable macro factors such as ETF momentum or regulatory clarity. Institutional Accumulation Adds Fuel Recent on-chain data shows over 82 million XRP, worth approximately $246 million, moved off exchanges into cold storage. This pattern typically signals accumulation by large holders, reinforcing the bullish case. Combined with declining selling pressure and rising trading volumes, market structure appears to favor upside movement. Why Amelie Might Be Right Amelie’s bold declaration isn’t just a gut feeling. It’s supported by a convergence of strong technical signals, optimistic price forecasts, institutional accumulation, and favorable macro conditions. In a market where sentiment often leads price, her timing could prove prophetic. If XRP decisively clears the $3.25 to $3.50 resistance in the coming days, a strong rally toward $4 or $5 in August looks increasingly likely, with potential to reach $9 or higher by mid-September in a breakout scenario. For XRP holders, this might just be the comeback season Amelie predicted. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-08-02 18:30:17,49436177,1754159417,"Coinbase Delists Function X, Lists New Tokens Amid Service Expansion","Coinbase, the first crypto firm to join the S&P 500 index, recently announced that it will suspend trading for Function X (FX) on August 15, 2025. Coinbase made this decision after a routine review process. This move is part of the exchange’s strategy to ensure all listed assets continue to meet its strict listing standards. Coinbase Drops FX, Adds New Tokens The leading crypto exchange, with an over $100 billion market cap , found that the Function X project team had paused the smart contract linked to the token. This came after the team recently migrated the original FX ERC-20 token to a new one called Pundi AI (PUNDIAI). As a result of this change, the old FX token no longer meets Coinbase’s listing standards. As of now, FX order books on Coinbase have been moved to limit-only mode. This means users can still place or cancel limit orders, and matches can happen. However, no new market orders are accepted. FX trading will be suspended across all Coinbase platforms, including Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. While removing FX, Coinbase is also adding new assets to its platform. As announced, Bio Protocol (BIO), BankrCoin (BNKR), and Treehouse (TREE) are now available for buying, selling, converting, sending, receiving, and storing. These tokens can be accessed through the Coinbase website and mobile apps on iOS and Android. Coinbase Partners With JP Morgan and Samsung This move comes as Coinbase is expanding its reach through new partnerships. In July, the company announced a partnership with JP Morgan Chase , one of the largest U.S. banks. This will allow its users to connect their Chase bank accounts directly. Also, users can now even use their Chase credit cards to earn and redeem crypto rewards. In addition, Coinbase has started rolling out Samsung Pay as a payment method for buying crypto. The feature is now available in the U.S. and Canada, making it easier for users to add money to their accounts. At the same time, the company continues to show strong confidence in Bitcoin (BTC). As of June 30, the company added 2,509 BTC in the second quarter of 2025. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 11,776 BTC, bought at a total cost of $740 million. Big Progress for Crypto Regulation in the U.S. Coinbase’s recent progress comes after big news for the U.S. crypto industry. In July, the Trump administration signed the GENIUS Act into law , helping to set clearer rules for digital assets. Another bill, called CLARITY, is also moving forward and now heads to the Senate. These new laws are expected to boost the crypto market and make investors feel more confident.

2025-08-02 18:30:00,49436845,1754159400,SHIB eyes 100% gains but analysts warn of a new generation memecoin breakout,"The Shiba Inu price prediction buzz is growing after a tough week, with traders watching for a fast rebound. At the same time, Remittix is earning real attention after raising over $17.9 million by selling 578 million tokens at $0.0895 each. Many see the Remittix DeFi project as a practical rival while some analysts hint that a fresh memecoin wave could arrive soon. Shiba Inu price prediction: cup and handle signals and key lines to beat Source: Joe Swanson On the daily chart, a classic cup and handle setup supports a constructive Shiba Inu price prediction if buyers defend recent lows. Despite the pullback, Shiba Inu held key support twice, which backs a patient Shiba Inu price prediction for a climb into August. If momentum returns, the Shiba Inu price prediction points to recoveries toward prior July highs, while a loss of support would delay the move. Analysts who track Shiba Inu also note double bottom hints and improving volume on green days, adding fuel to a cautious Shiba Inu price prediction. If price clears near term resistance with a strong daily close, the Shiba Inu price prediction for a 100 percent swing improves, though Shiba Inu must keep volume rising to confirm the break. With wider markets still shaky after the FOMC ripple effect, Shiba Inu needs clean closes to stay on track. Remittix (RTX): why traders see a utility play in a memecoin season Remittix aims to make cross border payouts simple with low gas fee crypto, Crypto staking, and a cross-chain DeFi project design for workers, freelancers, and businesses. It is crypto with real utility, a top crypto under $1, and a low cap crypto gems pick among upcoming crypto projects on top crypto to buy now lists. Many plan to buy RTX token as a best long term crypto investment and a next 100x crypto candidate. Here are six reasons it stands out right now: Solving a real world $19T payments problem Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK for trust and transparency Wallet beta launches in Q3 2025 Ideal for freelancers, remitters, and global earners One of the few projects with product progress In brief, if Shiba Inu clears resistance with rising volume, the 100 percent path opens.

2025-08-02 18:30:00,49434721,1754159400,Could This Be the Next $10 Coin? Investors Compare It to Chainlink (LINK) in Its First Year,"When Chainlink (LINK) first entered the crypto scene, it did so without hype or flash—but with a strong mission and a clear roadmap. Back then, most overlooked it as just another altcoin. Yet those who recognized its fundamentals and got in early saw massive returns, as LINK cemented itself as a key infrastructure player in decentralized finance. Today, the crypto world may be witnessing the beginning of another similar trajectory. A new project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads for all the right reasons and gaining serious attention for echoing LINK’s early momentum—except this time, with even more utility baked in from the start. Institutional-Level Infrastructure and Token Utility Already in Place Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale, but already giving off strong signals of long-term strength. The protocol is building a decentralized, non-custodial lending platform with both P2P and P2C models. Through the P2C model, lenders deposit stablecoins or blue-chip tokens like ETH, BTC, or USDT into smart contract pools and receive mtTokens, which not only represent their share of the pool but also grow in value as interest accrues. Borrowers, on the other hand, will be able to access overcollateralized loans using those same high-quality tokens as collateral—offering capital efficiency without needing to sell their holdings. Rates are governed by pool utilization, ensuring sustainable returns for lenders. The P2P system is designed for more flexible term-based deals, appealing to users seeking higher returns or bespoke agreements. But beyond lending mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is weaving in advanced tokenomics that many now consider the gold standard. One such feature is mtToken staking. Users who stake their mtTokens in designated smart contracts will earn MUTM as rewards—sourced directly from protocol revenue. Unlike inflationary models, the MUTM used for staking rewards will be bought back from the open market, creating continuous demand. In addition, the platform is preparing to launch its own decentralized stablecoin at listing. This stablecoin will be overcollateralized and minted only when a loan is issued, ensuring a controlled supply and maintaining a firm $1 peg. Borrowers will unlock it only by locking blue-chip assets, and it will be burned upon loan repayment—eliminating inflation risk and aligning supply with real-time market activity. To ensure trust and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underwent a CertiK audit, earning an impressive Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. This level of scrutiny, combined with a $50,000 bug bounty in collaboration with CertiK, signals a clear commitment to security—something Chainlink also focused heavily on during its foundational years. Furthermore, the platform’s upcoming integration with Layer-2 networks will unlock faster transactions and drastically reduced gas fees, making it far more accessible and scalable than most competitors. Presale Traction Signals Early Institutional Confidence As of now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, with over 10% of its 170 million token allocation already sold. That means investors have already poured in substantial capital—bringing total raised to more than $13.90 million across 14,800+ holders. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, representing a 15% increase, so the current entry point may very well be the final chance to secure tokens before listing momentum kicks in. To amplify community growth, a $100,000 giveaway is ongoing, rewarding 10 winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. It’s one of the few presales combining serious tokenomics with aggressive community engagement—two ingredients that drove LINK’s viral early-stage success. Those who bought into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at Phase 1, when the price was $0.01, are already sitting on a 6x gain. With the token expected to list at $0.06, current Phase 6 participants are still getting a highly discounted entry price. And with price targets from analysts suggesting $1.50 and beyond post-launch, early investors stand to capture over 30x upside from their entry. That kind of return places MUTM squarely in the same league as LINK’s historic rise during its first year of market exposure. The Road Ahead: A Four-Phase Plan Toward DeFi Dominance While the presale is building momentum, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is also methodically executing a clear four-phase roadmap. Phase 1 (Initiating) focused on launching the presale, completing the CertiK audit, and laying the foundation for listings and infrastructure. Phase 2 (Building) centers on development of the lending protocol, smart contract integrations, and Layer-2 support. Phase 3 (Finalizing) will include refining risk management, launching the stablecoin mechanism, and preparing liquidity pools. Phase 4 (Delivering) will see the full public beta rollout, protocol expansion, and long-term staking and reward modules. This isn’t a meme coin trying to ride hype—it’s a purpose-built financial protocol backed by robust technology and transparent execution. As Chainlink (LINK) has shown, true value comes from solving real problems and offering tools DeFi actually needs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following a similar playbook—only this time, with even more reward potential locked in at these early stages.

2025-08-02 18:24:59,49434276,1754159099,XRP Proponent Laments: So Ripple CEO Sold $200 Million of XRP at the Top,"A wave of frustration has swept through the XRP community following revelations that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold approximately $200 million worth of XRP near the recent market peak. The information, first flagged by blockchain analytics platform Xaif, was amplified in a post by prominent crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord, who questioned Garlinghouse’s faith in XRP’s long-term promise if he chose to offload such a substantial amount at the top. XRP sales linked to Garlinghouse’s wallets were reportedly spread over 10 days, sparking interest due to their large size and suspicious timing, which coincided with XRP’s local price peak. On-chain data from platforms like Lookonchain and confirmations from Xaif point to a deliberate and strategic liquidation that has unsettled parts of the XRP holder base. So Brad Garlinghouse sold $200m of $XRP at the top If it’s the future of finance why would he do that? This shit is starting to feel like a scam. The white house didn’t even mention it. I can feel a CTO coming on — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) August 1, 2025 Context: Past and Present XRP Sales This isn’t the first time Garlinghouse’s XRP holdings have raised eyebrows. In its 2020 lawsuit, the SEC disclosed that Garlinghouse sold approximately $600 million worth of XRP between 2017 and 2020, mainly on non-US exchanges. These earlier sales became central to the SEC’s claim that Ripple executives were profiting from unregistered securities offerings. With Ripple’s multi-year legal battle against the SEC nearing its end, some see the timing of this new $200 million sale as curious. In June 2025, Ripple Labs officially withdrew its cross-appeal against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following Judge Analisa Torres’ denial of the proposed final settlement agreement. The SEC is expected to follow suit, effectively closing one of the crypto industry’s most closely watched legal disputes. Community Reaction and Questions of Trust The backlash from the community has been swift. “If XRP is the future of finance, why would Brad sell now?” asked Crypto Bitlord. He also criticized the lack of government support, noting that the White House failed to mention XRP in its latest statements on digital asset innovation, further fueling fears that the project may be losing relevance on the national stage. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some users went as far as to call XRP a scam , citing these executive sell-offs as evidence that key figures are cashing out while everyday investors hold bags of hope. The sentiment was echoed by several influential voices on X, with one user stating, “It’s starting to feel like we’ve all been had.” Defending the Sale Supporters of Garlinghouse argue that executives are entitled to sell tokens for personal diversification, tax strategy, or liquidity, especially after years of navigating regulatory hostility. They also point out that Garlinghouse still holds significant XRP and Ripple equity, with his net worth estimated in the multi-billion-dollar range. Still, critics believe the optics are damaging. At a time when the XRP community is expecting utility breakthroughs and institutional adoption, a high-profile sale like this casts doubt on whether even Ripple’s leadership believes in the vision they’ve long championed.

2025-08-02 18:15:00,49435482,1754158500,"XRP to reach $10 by 2025, analysts say MUTM could follow with 30x returns","Could one of the best-performing cryptos of the decade soon be joined by a newcomer priced under 4 cents? While XRP sets its sights on a potential $10 rally by 2025, attention is turning toward another project that’s still in presale but showing early signs of outsized growth potential. With its current price at just $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being positioned by analysts as the next big cryptocurrency to watch. Ripple (XRP) price prediction: heading toward $10? XRP has been quietly climbing since early 2024, and recent forecasts suggest that the cryptocurrency could hit $10 by the end of 2025. That projection isn’t built on hype—it reflects a broader shift in institutional support, improving regulatory clarity, and the growing adoption of Ripple’s payment infrastructure. While volatility remains, analysts have pointed to the token’s recovery from sub-$1 levels to its recent position above $3 as a sign that momentum is real. Some forecasts even lean on technical patterns such as Elliott Wave theory and Fibonacci retracements to justify the $10 price point. Others cite major whale movements, rising trading volume, and Ripple’s expanding presence in global remittances. Regardless of the method, the takeaway is clear: XRP is no longer flying under the radar, and its current price action reflects a wider trend of accumulation across top cryptocurrencies. What is Mutuum Finance and why experts say it has 30x potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new decentralized protocol built around real DeFi utility. Its model is centered on lending and borrowing, with users able to participate through smart contract-based liquidity pools. What sets it apart, though, is that it supports both overcollateralized borrowing and passive lending through a dynamic dual-token system. Users receive mtTokens when depositing assets, which represent their share of the pool and automatically accrue value through interest. The protocol is preparing to launch a beta version of its platform shortly after token listing, a move that analysts believe will have a significant impact on its adoption. This post-launch milestone is expected to open the door for top-tier centralized exchange (CEX) listings, increasing exposure and buy pressure from new participants. With the launch price locked in at $0.06 and the presale still in Phase 6 at $0.035, the upside is already locked in for early buyers—around 100% gains at listing. Analysts who are tracking presale performance and token utility believe MUTM could climb as high as 30x, driven by rising demand, incoming product rollout, and the momentum that follows a successful launch on CEXs. When it hits that target, the token would be trading near $1.05, making it one of the most profitable tokens of the cycle. Why timing matters: entry at $0.035 could lead to massive gains With more than $13.8 million raised and over 14,700 holders, Mutuum Finance is one of the fastest-growing DeFi presales currently live. Phase 6 is already active, and as each phase sells out, the token price edges closer to its final listing value. For those entering now at $0.035, the difference is clear. A $2,000 investment at today’s price would yield approximately 58,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $1.05, that same position would be worth over $60,000. That’s the power of early entry in a well-structured cryptocurrency presale, especially when the fundamentals are strong and there’s a defined roadmap post-launch. Unlike many tokens that go live with no real ecosystem in place, Mutuum Finance has outlined clear next steps, including the beta platform release and multichain expansion. Additionally, the team is currently undergoing a CertiK smart contract audit, which adds another layer of trust. CertiK is one of the most respected blockchain auditing firms, and a successful audit not only boosts investor confidence but also serves as a positive signal for CEX listings. The protocol has also opened a security bug bounty, strengthening its infrastructure ahead of the platform’s public rollout. Could this be the best crypto to buy now? With XRP aiming for $10 and gaining traction in institutional circles, attention is shifting toward earlier-stage opportunities with similarly high upside. Mutuum Finance stands out among new crypto coins by offering a working product model, real token utility, and a built-in rewards mechanism through its buy-and-redistribute system, which sends a portion of revenue back to mtToken stakers. This creates an organic way to generate passive income for long-term holders. It’s rare to find a new DeFi crypto this early in development that’s also passed the $13M fundraising milestone and still offers entry under $0.04. Whether you’re looking for the next crypto to hit $1 or simply seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in before broader adoption, MUTM is gaining attention for all the right reasons. While XRP may dominate crypto news today with its $10 target, Mutuum Finance offers a different type of opportunity—one where entry now could turn a few thousand dollars into life-changing returns. Phase 6 is still live, but won’t be for long. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, this could be the window.

2025-08-02 18:01:08,49433270,1754157668,Inside GAIA’s Plan to Democratize AI With Open Infrastructure (Exclusive Interview),"GAIA has partnered with Samsung to launch a limited-edition AI-native phone, built on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Designed for AI sovereignty, the device enables users to run large language models directly on-device, eliminating cloud dependency while offering privacy, ownership, and rewards through its decentralized AI ecosystem. In this interview, Shashank Sripada, the project’s COO and Co-founder, explains how the GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 aims to make AI sovereignty tangible, offering users direct control over their data and digital assistants from the device itself. You describe GAIA as enabling “AI sovereignty.” In practical terms, what does that mean for the average user in regions where privacy concerns are high but technical literacy is low? AI sovereignty means control over your data, models, and the intelligence that acts on your behalf. For users in high-privacy regions with limited technical skill, GAIA offers turnkey domains and agent templates that let anyone deploy personal AI tools without ceding control to cloud platforms. Practically, this means: Your data stays local – inference can happen on-device or in a domain you control. You choose the agent – whether it’s open-source or fine-tuned to your context. No centralized surveillance – responses are composable, auditable, and censorship-resistant. Think of it like Signal meets ChatGPT – but powered by you, not a trillion-dollar cloud monopoly. Some argue that decentralized AI layers will simply recreate centralization under different labels if network participation is limited. How will GAIA avoid this pitfall? GAIA’s network economics, architecture, and governance are specifically designed to resist re-centralization: Open Node Access: Anyone can run a node – even on mobile or low-power edge devices – and stake to participate in inference. Deterministic Reward Distribution: Node rewards are tied to performance and decentralization, not centralized hosting or capital. Decentralized Domains & Agents: Value capture happens at the edge – meaning builders, not just validators or miners, accrue value. On-chain governance: Protocol upgrades and reward structures are governed by token holders, not a centralized foundation. In short, participation is low-barrier and structurally distributed. The economic incentives scale with decentralization, not against it. What regulatory or legal challenges do you anticipate GAIA facing with operating on-device AI inference and integrated wallets, especially with jurisdictions that have strict rules on AI and crypto? We’re proactively navigating this intersection of AI and crypto with a jurisdiction-aware architecture: On-device inference is akin to running local software or using open-source tools – not a regulated service on its own. Integrated wallets follow existing patterns from dApps and DeFi, but we ensure non-custodial design, user consent flows, and limited data exposure to stay clear of financial intermediation triggers. Jurisdictional fallback: Where required, GAIA can implement region-specific gating, disclosures, or compliance toggles, especially around KYC, model access, and token transfers. Partnerships with legal advisors in the US, EU, and Asia ensure we’re compliant with evolving AI transparency, explainability, and crypto rulesets. Regulation is inevitable – and GAIA’s modular structure makes it adaptable to emerging norms without compromising decentralization. How does GAIA plan to handle potential regulatory challenges around crypto rewards tied to hardware sales, especially in the US, where token incentives may trigger securities scrutiny? The GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 is designed to demonstrate what a fully decentralized AI interface looks like – one that is both sovereign by design and modular by implementation. From a regulatory perspective, GAIA avoids direct entanglements by ensuring that: The hardware functions as an open AI device, not as a financial instrument or token distribution tool. On-device inference is local-first and privacy-preserving – akin to using offline AI models or edge apps – not a hosted or custodial service. The integration of Web3 infrastructure (wallets, domain management, agent registries) follows non-custodial patterns, allowing users to interact with decentralized networks on their terms. Crucially, the GAIA Phone does not require any blockchain interaction to operate as a powerful AI assistant. This allows the phone to ship globally with optional features gated or localized based on regional legal norms – ensuring compliance without compromising on the broader vision. Rather than embedding financial assumptions into hardware, GAIA’s approach centers on empowering users to run private, autonomous AI agents locally – with full transparency, auditability, and freedom from centralized gatekeepers. Consumer education could be a major hurdle for Gaia’s adoption. Practically, how will you convince crypto users accustomed to wallets and DeFi to trust a decentralized AI phone, and what incentives or network effects will drive them to become node operators? The GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 is more than a phone – it’s a blueprint for how AI should work in a decentralized world. It delivers an experience that is immediately useful, deeply private, and intuitively extensible, even for non-technical users. Here’s how we’re solving the consumer onboarding challenge: Out-of-the-box utility The phone ships with pre-installed on-device AI agents that work from day one – including smart assistants, workspace copilots, and knowledge managers. Users experience low-latency, offline AI without needing to log in to cloud APIs – reducing friction and boosting trust. Seamless Web3 integration (without the learning curve) GAIA’s mobile stack includes a built-in wallet and agent registry, but is designed to be opt-in, non-custodial, and user-directed. Users can onboard into domains, deploy their own agents, or build automations via visual interfaces, not smart contract code. Real-world relevance and differentiation: Unlike typical phones that outsource intelligence to centralized servers, the GAIA phone empowers users to own their compute, their data, and their decision layer. This directly appeals to users in regions with strong data sovereignty values, privacy expectations, and distrust of platform monopolies. In effect, the GAIA phone makes decentralized AI tangible – not as an abstract concept, but as a daily tool that’s faster, safer, and smarter than the cloud. It’s our most powerful demonstration yet of how GAIA’s infrastructure can scale into the hands of millions – not through ideology, but through utility.

2025-08-02 18:00:49,49433629,1754157649,"Best Crypto Gambling Sites in 2025 Ranked, Spartans’ Position Might Surprise You","As crypto gambling sites in 2025 continue gaining momentum, users are no longer satisfied with flashy themes alone. They now expect faster speeds, transparent features, higher RTPs, and seamless play. Simply relying on brand hype is no longer enough. Platforms that prioritize real user satisfaction and fast payouts are now leading the pack. This breakdown ranks the five most talked-about crypto gambling sites this year, Stake.com, Roobet, BC.Game, BetMGM, and Spartans, based on essential usability factors like user interface, crypto compatibility, RTP reliability, and in-game flow. You’ll see how each one performs and why Spartans.com may be the most overlooked gem. 1. Spartans: The Sleekest & Fastest-Performing Crypto Gambling Site in 2025 Although Spartans .com is a relatively new entry among crypto gambling sites in 2025, it’s setting the bar in all the right ways. Built specifically for crypto users, the platform allows lightning-fast deposits and withdrawals in BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and AVAX, offering instant wallet connections and basic access without mandatory KYC. Its interface is sharp, combining simplicity with depth, making it easy to move between casino, sportsbook, and live games without confusion. Spartans stands out in RTP clarity and smooth gameplay. Every slot and live game runs without lag, even in mobile browsers. Its built-in betslip calculator and live stats tools give sports bettors an advantage, and the site’s crash and game show formats seem tailored for crypto-savvy users. Promotions include daily reload bonuses, clear giveaways, and even a Lamborghini prize, all with transparent rules. While Stake.com still leads in visibility, Spartans proves that fast and consistent performance is what keeps players returning. 2. Stake.com: Top Choice for Community & Global Brand Presence Stake.com remains a leader among crypto gambling sites in 2025, widely known for its global recognition, celebrity sponsorships, and loyal user base. Its desktop interface remains clean and user-friendly, and its betting slip system is still one of the best for combining multiple wagers. Stake excels in features that encourage community interaction, such as live chat and group betting, making it feel like a social platform. The platform supports quick crypto transactions and a broad list of tokens, including BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP. However, RTP reliability varies by provider, and it hasn’t fully embraced newer Web3 wallet integrations. For users who value brand recognition and community features, Stake.com is still a strong pick, though more performance-driven users might seek alternatives this year. 3. Roobet: Strong Game Variety but UI Design Needs Attention Roobet performs well in terms of licensing and game selection, offering thousands of titles from well-known providers. It supports BTC, ETH, and USDC for fast transactions and has added some limited smart contract withdrawal options. Performance is generally solid, and unique games like “Roobet Crash” remain popular with users. However, the platform’s interface can feel cluttered, especially on mobile devices. The design lacks the clarity seen in newer crypto gambling sites, and gameplay may lag during peak hours. While Roobet remains popular due to its long-term presence and loyalty perks, the interface could use a serious redesign to improve user experience. 4. BC.Game: Full of Features, but Not Ideal for Beginners BC.Game continues to rank among the top crypto gambling sites in 2025 when it comes to token support and DeFi tools. It accepts a huge range of cryptocurrencies and features its own utility token, which connects directly to bonuses and games. With options like mini-games, provably fair content, and shared jackpots, it has no shortage of variety for active players. The downside is that the platform can overwhelm newcomers. The homepage is packed with pop-ups, spinning bonus wheels, and constant chat windows, which can distract from actual gaming. Although it does well in RTP performance and crypto transaction speed, the noisy interface makes the experience less smooth. BC.Game works well for crypto veterans but may not suit players seeking simplicity. 5. BetMGM: Reliable Reputation, But Limited Crypto Support BetMGM, known for its roots in traditional betting, has cautiously entered the crypto gambling scene. The platform features one of the best-designed sportsbook layouts and polished casino interfaces. However, it only supports major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and withdrawals often take hours or require ID checks. RTP rates are dependable, and its partnerships with trusted providers like Evolution and NetEnt guarantee stable gameplay. Still, BetMGM trails behind in terms of wallet responsiveness and overall in-game flow. It’s a safe option for players who prefer established brands, but it lacks the agility crypto users have come to expect. Identifying the Best Crypto Gambling Site in 2025 There’s no shortage of crypto gambling sites in 2025 , but only a few truly meet the needs of today’s players. Stake.com still dominates in terms of brand and community features, while Roobet and BC.Game bring solid content and token variety. BetMGM delivers a familiar feel with traditional backing, yet falls short on crypto execution. Then there’s Spartans, the newcomer that avoids marketing fluff and delivers what really matters: fast gameplay, transparent features, and reliable crypto support. If you’re ready to upgrade from casual play to a rewarding and efficient crypto gambling experience, Spartans could be your smartest move this year.

2025-08-02 18:00:47,49434317,1754157647,‘Chokepoint 3.0’ Has Arrived? a16z Warns of Anti-Crypto Bank Tactics,"Big banks are making it harder and more expensive for consumers to use fintech and crypto apps, which amounts to what could be seen as ""Operation Chokepoint 3.0."" That’s according to Alex Rampell, General Partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). In its latest fintech newsletter , Rampell pointed to traditional financial institutions charging high fees to access account data or move money, particularly to services like Coinbase or Robinhood, as a move to strangle the competition. ""Under the Biden administration, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 tried to debank and deplatform crypto,"" Rampell said. ""That era has ended, but now the banks are aiming to implement their own Chokepoint 3.0 — charging insanely high fees to access data or move money to crypto and fintech apps — and, more concerningly, blocking crypto and fintech apps they don’t like,"" he added. Chokepoint 2.0 refers specifically to the debanking of crypto businesses and executives as a result of pressure exerted during President Joe Biden’s administration by regulatory authorities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). After Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, the Chokepoint 2.0 ended as regulators reversed many of the directives put in place during the previous administration. JPMorgan accusation JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest U.S. banks, was singled out as an example. Under current U.S. law, specifically Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, consumers have a right to access their own financial data. But banks are now asserting control over how that data is delivered electronically, sometimes charging fees for access to information as basic as routing and account numbers. A16z’s executive argued that such tactics could make transferring funds to alternative platforms more costly, deterring users and reducing competition. “If it suddenly costs $10 to move $100 into a crypto account,” Rampell wrote, “maybe fewer people will do it. And if JPM and others can block consumers from connecting their own freely chosen crypto and fintech apps to their bank accounts, they effectively eliminate competition.” Rampell’s words echo those of Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, who said JPMorgan charging fintech platforms for access to customer banking data will “bankrupt” them. “This is the kind of egregious regulatory capture that kills innovation, hurts the American consumer, and is bad for America.” Read more: Winklevoss Claims JPMorgan Halted Gemini Onboarding After Data Access Fees Criticism JPMorgan hasn’t address the platform directly, but did address the criticism. The bank told Forbes that nearly 2 billion monthly requests for user data come from third parties, and that by charging fees it aims to curb misuse. Rampell, meanwhile, is calling on the Trump administration to stop such practices by the banks before they become standard among the rest of the financial institutions. ""In a perfect world, consumers would vote with their wallets. But every bank will likely do this, and getting a new banking charter takes years. Many banks have hostages, not customers,"" Rampell said. ""We don’t need a new law; we just need the administration to prevent this callous and manipulative attempt to kill competition and consumer choice,"" he added.",Finance|JPMorgan|Andreessen horowit|Crypto|Fintech|Operation Chokepoint|News,EN,0,big bank making harder expensive consumer use fintech crypto apps amount could seen operation chokepoint according alex rampell general partner venture capital firm andreessen horowitz latest fintech newsletter rampell pointed traditional financial institution charging high fee access account data move money particularly service like coinbase robinhood move strangle competition biden administration operation chokepoint tried debank deplatform crypto rampell said era ended bank aiming implement chokepoint charging insanely high fee access data move money crypto fintech apps concerningly blocking crypto fintech apps like added chokepoint refers specifically debanking crypto business executive result pressure exerted president joe biden administration regulatory authority like federal deposit insurance corp fdic donald trump elected president chokepoint ended regulator reversed many directive put place previous administration jpmorgan accusation jpmorgan chase one largest bank singled example current law specifically section act consumer right access financial data bank asserting control data delivered electronically sometimes charging fee access information basic routing account number executive argued tactic could make transferring fund alternative platform costly deterring user reducing competition suddenly cost move crypto account rampell wrote maybe fewer people jpm others block consumer connecting freely chosen crypto fintech apps bank account effectively eliminate rampell word echo gemini tyler winklevoss said jpmorgan charging fintech platform access customer banking data bankrupt kind egregious regulatory capture kill innovation hurt american consumer bad read winklevoss claim jpmorgan halted gemini onboarding data access fee criticism jpmorgan address platform directly address criticism bank told forbes nearly billion monthly request user data come third party charging fee aim curb misuse rampell meanwhile calling trump administration stop practice bank become standard among rest financial institution perfect world consumer would vote wallet every bank likely getting new banking charter take year many bank hostage customer rampell said need new law need administration prevent callous manipulative attempt kill competition consumer choice added,0.124,0.789,0.087,-0.9282,0

2025-08-02 18:00:20,49433273,1754157620,3 Key Ethena (ENA) Support Levels To Monitor – Analyst,"Ethena (ENA) prices are presently in the red zone during a broader crypto market correction. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the DeFi token recorded a significant 2.00% loss in the past day, with prices presently set hovering around $0.55. Amidst this price decline, top market analyst Ali Martinez has identified the major support regions that investors should monitor in the event of any further price retracement. Related Reading: Ethereum Drops 6% After Hitting $3,800, But Analysts See New ATH Ahead Ethena CBD Shows Key Price Floors At $0.47, $0.44, And $0.35 According to Martinez, the cost basis distribution (CBD) model has revealed the three short-term relevant support zones in the ENA market. For context, the CBD model is an on-chain framework that visualizes the amount of tokens accumulated at various price levels. It is used to identify important price zones, i.e., potential support or resistance levels, based on their registered volumes of accumulation. In the chart above, it is observed that the more intense (warmer) the color, the higher the greater supply concentration of ENA at that level. Based on this system, it can be inferred that the immediate support levels for ENA currently lie around $0.44 and $0.47, where significant price clusters have been formed in the last month. However, if a compelling selling pressure forces the ENA price below this support zone, investors should anticipate the next price halt around $0.35. This price region is presently the strongest support in the Ethena market, as shown by the deepest red horizontal bar on the CBD model, which represents an estimated $1 billion ENA supply cluster. Notably, a price crash to the $0.35 support zone indicates a potential estimated 37.5% loss from current prices. Meanwhile, the CBD model also reveals that ENA’s next price resistance sits around the $0.60, at which lies the next immediate cluster above the spot price. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) DeFi TVL Rises Nearly 40% Following Octane Upgrade Ethena Price Outlook At the time of writing, ENA trades at $0.57, reflecting a 2.08% decline in the last 24 hours as earlier stated. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 2.05% indicating a slight rise in market engagement and transaction volume. According to CoinCodex, investor sentiment remains strongly bullish, with 67% of the past month’s trading days closing in the green. Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index sits at 65, reflecting a relatively strong appetite for risk among investors. However, Coincodex analysts hold a cautious market view with predictions of $0.46 and $0.45 in the next five and 30 days, respectively. Meanwhile, their long-term forecast project ENA to also trade around $0.46 in the next three months.

2025-08-02 18:00:09,49433226,1754157609,"SHIB Falls, SOL Slows, and Spartans Gains: Why the Crypto Market Is Shifting Toward Utility","While parts of the crypto market face hesitation, some tokens are creating concern rather than confidence. Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 7% after a 5-trillion token transfer from Coinbase, raising questions about a possible selloff or supply crunch. Solana touched $200 briefly but could not stay there, with weak signals pointing to a drop toward $185. Both tokens are raising doubts among holders. At the same time, Spartans.com is moving forward. With 5,963 games and crypto-only support for casino and sports betting, Spartans is emerging as one of the top crypto betting platforms. While SHIB and SOL face strong resistance, more users are turning to platforms that offer real value now instead of waiting for prices to recover. Spartans meets that demand directly. Large SHIB Transfer Creates Confusion in the Market A 5-trillion SHIB token transfer, worth close to $70 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet has left Shiba Inu watchers unsettled. The token dropped 7% and trades near $0.00001407, showing increased tension. Some see it as a bearish sign ahead of more selling. Others think it may lead to a supply squeeze if demand picks up. The technical data is mixed. SHIB faces resistance at $0.00001435, with room to rise to $0.000018 or even $0.000026 if momentum returns. The CMF and RSI show the token is still active. But a 36% fall in active SHIB addresses in two days suggests users are stepping back. While the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price reaction could move higher if shorts get cleared out, the large transfer has made the market uneasy. For now, SHIB’s short-term path depends on how major holders and regular users react to the shift. Solana Pullback Signals Market Uncertainty Solana’s latest move has created more doubt than strength. It briefly passed $200 but fell to $192.57, unable to hold its gain. Technical readings show ADX at 15.49, a sign of a weak trend. Supertrend and Parabolic SAR also point to a likely pullback to $185 or even $171.73. Still, it is not all negative. If Solana can regain strength and close above key resistance, a rally toward $242.57 is still possible. But for now, traders remain cautious about the Solana (SOL) price movement. Low strength and slowing momentum are blocking SOL’s climb at the moment. As that plays out, more users are turning to platforms that are based on usage, not just price action. Exploring Spartans: Where Utility Replaces Uncertainty In contrast to the ongoing price swings of crypto assets, Spartans.com offers clear value through direct use, fast performance, and steady activity. With 5,963 games including slots, blackjack, crash games, baccarat, roulette, and live game shows, it appeals to crypto users looking for more than market charts. There is no need for fiat or third-party steps. Everything runs on crypto for easy access. Spartans is now one of the leading crypto betting platforms and includes a full sportsbook for global events. Users can bet on football, basketball, UFC, tennis, and more, with real-time odds and live updates. Its betslip system is built for fast use, allowing players to go from watching to betting without delay. The site supports many cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, and ADA. Withdrawals are processed quickly without bank wait times. New users can claim a 300% bonus for casino and sports sections, while regular players benefit from a 25% daily deposit bonus. For those aiming higher, Spartans also runs a Lamborghini giveaway. Anyone can join by signing up, depositing, and taking part. That’s all it takes to enter.

2025-08-02 18:00:00,49433944,1754157600,"Forget Cardano (ADA): Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) CoinMarketCap Debut Sparks One of the Fastest Current Presales, Analysts Predict 100x Before 2026","Cardano (ADA) has long been heralded as one of the most innovative cryptocurrencies in the blockchain space. But as its momentum slows, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is accelerating at breakneck speed, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts globally. Since its CoinMarketCap (CMC) debut , Ruvi AI has seen unprecedented presale success , with over 1 million tokens sold daily and 70% of Phase 2 completed in record time. With analysts forecasting a potential 100x return before 2026 , Ruvi AI is shaping up to be the must-watch token of the year. Combined with its innovative blend of blockchain and AI , audited security, and an upcoming 33% price increase , now is the time for investors to take notice. How CoinMarketCap Boosted Ruvi AI’s Success CoinMarketCap isn’t just a platform, it’s a seal of legitimacy in the crypto world. A listing on CMC brings immediate validation , global exposure, and credibility. For Ruvi AI, this milestone launch put the token on the map, propelling it into a frenzy of investor interest. Numbers Show Explosive Growth 1 Million Tokens Sold Daily: Demand for Ruvi AI is accelerating like no other presale in 2025. 70% of Phase 2 Completed: Over 210 million tokens have already been claimed. $2.6 Million Raised: A testament to Ruvi AI’s growing popularity among retail and institutional buyers alike. Phase 2 is ending soon, and the token price will rise from $0.015 to $0.020, a 33% increase. Investors sitting on the sidelines risk being priced out of one of the fastest-growing opportunities in crypto. Why Ruvi AI Outshines Cardano Cardano has built its reputation on scalability and long-term vision, but Ruvi AI offers something Cardano doesn’t , immediate utility and practical, AI-driven solutions. By combining real-world applications with blockchain architecture , Ruvi AI is primed for both rapid adoption and sustained growth. What Makes Ruvi AI Unique? 1. Cutting-Edge AI Integration Ruvi AI doesn’t rely solely on speculative value. Its platform delivers AI-powered tools that help businesses optimize marketing, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency. These solutions give Ruvi AI a distinct advantage, making it more than just a token. 2. Blockchain-Powered Payment Systems Ruvi AI solves one of the gig economy’s biggest frustrations, unreliable payments. Freelancers, influencers, and creators benefit from secure, instant, and transparent payment systems , which deliver trust and accuracy at scale. 3. Cross-Industry Versatility While Cardano focuses on blockchain advancements, Ruvi AI applies its technology across various sectors, including healthcare, education, finance, and entertainment. This adaptability ensures it caters to a broad range of users, giving it massive global appeal. VIP Bonuses Deliver Unbeatable ROI One of the key drivers behind Ruvi AI’s presale frenzy is its tiered VIP bonus system , which rewards early investors with unparalleled returns. VIP 2 ($750 Investment): Secures 50,000 tokens at $0.015 each plus a 40% bonus , adding 20,000 extra tokens for a total of 70,000 tokens. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, this investment turns into $70,000, a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 Investment): Provides 100,000 tokens plus a 60% bonus , adding another 60,000 tokens for a total of 160,000 tokens. At $1, this transforms into $160,000, a remarkable 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 Investment): Awards 500,000 tokens and doubles holdings with a 100% bonus (an additional 500,000 tokens) for a total of 1 million tokens. When valued at $1, this becomes an incredible $1 million, an awe-inspiring 13,233% ROI. Leaderboard Rewards Create Additional Incentives Ruvi AI’s leaderboard system adds extra perks, offering top contributors up to 500,000 bonus tokens . For major investors, these rewards make participation even more lucrative. Built on Trust and Security While many tokens rely on hype alone, Ruvi AI emphasizes trust and reliability, underpinned by a comprehensive CyberScope audit. CyberScope Audit Highlights Tamper-Proof Smart Contracts: Designed to safeguard investor funds against vulnerabilities or manipulation. Transparent Blockchain Framework: Every transaction can be traced, fostering accountability and trust. This commitment to security ensures that Ruvi AI is not only set for growth but grounded in safety, a key differentiator in today’s volatile market. Why Timing Is Critical With over 1 million tokens selling daily and Phase 2 coming to an end, the opportunity to buy Ruvi AI at $0.015 is quickly evaporating. The 33% price hike to $0.020 marks a turning point, solidifying its status as one of the fastest-growing presales in crypto history. Analysts predicting 100x returns before 2026 only add urgency to Ruvi AI’s momentum. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting out, this is the kind of early-stage opportunity that could change everything. Don’t settle for lagging projects. Instead, capitalize on Ruvi AI’s explosive rise and secure your stake in the next big thing before it’s too late. Act now and join the wave reshaping cryptocurrency’s future.

2025-08-02 17:50:00,49433494,1754157000,"After Binance Coin (BNB), Here Are 4 More Cryptos Set to Skyrocket to Record Highs and Deliver Huge Gains","As Binance Coin (BNB) records consistent profits in the crypto market, four other cryptocurrencies are in the spotlight. These are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and the emerging presale project, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), all of which have the potential to perform well before Q4. Shiba Inu Shows Renewed Strength Over the past 30 days, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a 26% price increase. The token began July at about $0.00001133 and surged to $0.000016 before a slight correction. Currently, SHIB trades at $0.00001435 with a market cap of $8.46 billion and a daily volume of $192.5 million. Analysts believe SHIB could triple in value before Q4, supported by positive market sentiment. In addition, the continued growth of the ecosystem and community involvement are factors that drive its growth. It has been performing better than other meme coins in the recent past, which has led to new investor interest. Solana Gains Institutional Momentum Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $194 and trying to surpass its earlier 2021 high of $294. In recent weeks, the network has registered consistent institutional inflows. Increased developer activity, alongside a strong DeFi and NFT presence, has positioned Solana as a key infrastructure layer in the ecosystem. It now supports over 1,000 projects. Also, Solana has a special Proof of History consensus mechanism, which provides high throughput of more than 50,000 transactions per second. This gives it an advantage in performance compared to its rivals. Furthermore, the possibility of a Solana ETF has sparked additional optimism among retail and institutional buyers. XRP Benefits from Regulatory Progress XRP is among the best-performing large-cap assets, rising by 450% over the last year. The relative legal clarity of Ripple has enabled the project to extend its cross-border payment focus. The continued adoption of RippleNet by financial institutions has made XRP relevant in real-world utility. Major financial actors are still interested in the potential of the token in terms of banking integrations. In addition, its contribution to international settlements has been enhanced as lawsuits are relaxed. Investors are awaiting indications of a complete recovery in the XRP price in Q3 and Q4. Also, as the regulations and use-case adoption improve, XRP will be able to restore long-term investor confidence. Little Pepe Presale Generates Rapid Interest Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is currently in Stage 8 of its presale, priced at $0.0017 per token. Over $13.12 million has been raised, surpassing expectations. More than 9.4 billion tokens have already been sold. The presale is nearing its $13.7 million target, with Stage 9 priced at $0.0018. Additionally, the project has launched a $777,000 giveaway during the presale, rewarding ten investors with $77,000 each. One has to invest at least $100 to join. Little Pepe is an Ethereum Layer 2 chain, which allows inexpensive and rapid transactions and future compatibility with decentralized applications. It includes a sniper bot shield to protect presale and post-launch participants from automated trading. No extra taxes or fees are charged on trades, allowing users full access to their tokens. Furthermore, staking is available for holders seeking passive income, and a DAO system is in place for community governance and voting. The project has plans for a meme token launchpad to support new meme-based crypto assets. It also plans to release NFTs, cross-chain tools, and more DeFi features in the future. Conclusion As Binance Coin is still on the rise, SHIB, SOL, XRP, and, in particular, Little Pepe have high upside potential. Little Pepe has real blockchain infrastructure, fast presale development, and progressive features. Investors are making early bets as the token approaches its hard cap, hoping to see a breakout.

2025-08-02 17:31:42,49432592,1754155902,Mistral announces plan to raise $1B at a $10B valuation,"Mistral is targeting a bumper cash inflow that could push its valuation to $10B in a new fundraising round as it pushes to compete with U.S. and Chinese competitors. The French AI startup is seeking $1B in new funding to position itself as Europe’s leading competitor to U.S. and Chinese AI firms with deeper pockets. Mistral’s $1B raise to scale infrastructure and product reach The new fundraising round will value the company at approximately $10B, marking a significant jump from its previous €5.8B valuation. The planned raise includes interest from venture capital investors and Abu Dhabi’s MGX AI fund. The proceeds are expected to support the commercial rollout of Mistral’s chatbot and further improve its LLMs. Since its inception in 2023, Mistral has positioned itself as an alternative to U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google. The company’s LLMs are designed to be modular and accessible, allowing users to adapt the models to their unique needs. Since its last fundraising in June 2024, when it raised €600M, Mistral is now on track to exceed $100M in annual revenue if its current sales momentum holds. That growth has been largely driven by a few high-value enterprise contracts. Current customers of the company include BNP Paribas, AXA, and CMA CGM, whose billionaire owner Rodolphe Saadé is also a supporter of the startup. Mistral’s investor base also includes Lightspeed Venture Partners, General Catalyst, France’s public investment bank BPI France, and telecom magnate Xavier Niel. Europe wants its own sovereign AI French President Emmanuel Macron has been an advocate for the development of a “sovereign” European AI, and Mistral is widely considered the region’s best shot at building such a capability. However, U.S. rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic have set a high bar in technological scale and fundraising. Mistral’s $10B target, while impressive for a two-year-old start-up, shows the gap between the company and U.S. industry leaders. The firm’s emphasis on openness and model customization places it in competition with Meta’s Llama models and China’s Deepseek, both of which are pushing modular and freely accessible AI tools. In May, the company announced its plans to build a large-scale data center outside Paris as part of its long-term strategy to support AI model training and deployment. The new capital could help progress this data center effort, increasing Mistral’s capacity to scale its models and serve a bigger customer base.

2025-08-02 17:30:52,49432026,1754155852,Stellar (XLM) Price Performance Surge & NEAR Protocol Rally Highlight Cold Wallet at $0.00942 as Top Crypto to Buy,"The recent Stellar (XLM) price performance surge and the Near Protocol (NEAR) price rally show one thing clearly: the market still values real use cases and visible growth. Stellar is holding gains after one of its most impressive monthly performances, while NEAR is picking up pace with notable trading volume and ecosystem expansion. But if you’re analyzing options for the top crypto to buy in 2025, it might be time to focus on how everyday crypto usage could become a revenue stream. You’re already paying fees and moving assets. Cold Wallet ($CWT) turns those actions into rewards through its token CWT, currently available at $0.00942, with much higher upside potential ahead. Cold Wallet Makes Holding CWT More Rewarding Every Day Every transaction costs money, swaps, gas, and transfers. Cold Wallet challenges that cost model. Its token, CWT, gives you back a portion of those fees without the need for staking, contracts, or waiting periods. Just hold CWT and get rewards as you use the wallet. This makes it one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025 for users who want more than passive price exposure. The presale structure is built for growth. CWT is currently priced at $0.00942, marking the entry point in a 150-stage process that concludes with a launch price of $0.35171. Analysts suggest a path to $2 after the token hits exchanges, offering early participants a chance at returns up to 285x. What’s more, the model doesn’t just focus on numbers; it builds a reward-driven wallet experience. Holding more CWT boosts your cashback tier, with the top level offering a full 100% gas rebate. Rather than betting on future hype, it delivers a functioning product that pays users for activity. For those planning ahead, this is more than buying into a token. It’s gaining access to an ecosystem built with user alignment from the beginning. And with the presale live now, Cold Wallet presents a clear opportunity for those evaluating the top crypto to buy in 2025 before wider attention arrives. Stellar (XLM) Price Surge Reflects July Strength The Stellar (XLM) price performance at the end of July continues to attract attention. After rising between 75% and 85% in one month, it’s now trading near $0.44 following a brief pullback. From $0.424 on July 24 to $0.442, Stellar is finding support near $0.39 and resistance in the $0.46 to $0.52 range. Analysts are watching closely, with targets as high as $0.71 possible if favourable market conditions continue, and even $1 is being mentioned as a longer-term goal. From a technical perspective, Stellar remains in a positive position. It trades above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, while its RSI of 62 shows sustainable buying pressure. Although the MACD points to slight bearish divergence, many traders see this as a period of consolidation before a potential upward breakout. The key is whether XLM can breach resistance and extend July’s momentum into the new month. Near Protocol’s Rally Builds on Ecosystem Growth The Near Protocol (NEAR) price rally since July 25 has captured attention, with the token jumping from $2.61 to $2.79 within a single session. This move was supported by growing institutional demand and increased trading volume. NEAR even hit $2.97 before pulling back to $2.67 as the wider altcoin market cooled. Resistance now sits between $2.83 and $2.90, while support is holding around $2.61, with lower support at $2.11 and $1.79. These levels reflect short-term volatility following a bigger rally earlier in July, which was fueled by new partnerships, including one with Everclear. Technically, NEAR shows mixed signals. It’s trading above its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages but remains under its 200-day SMA at $2.95, a level it must retake to maintain momentum. The RSI is near 53, signalling neutral territory, while MACD trends show light bearish divergence. A move above $2.90, if accompanied by volume, could confirm this rally as the start of a longer trend rather than a temporary spike. Key Insights The Stellar (XLM) price performance surge and the Near Protocol (NEAR) price rally both reflect strong technicals and real development progress. Stellar is steady around $0.44 after its best month in years, and NEAR continues its attempt to push beyond $2.90, helped by solid fundamentals. Still, for those looking beyond trading swings, Cold Wallet introduces a different value proposition. CWT, priced at $0.00942 in its early presale, is built to reward users for every gas fee, bridge, and swap, converting regular activity into real income. With a presale at $0.00942 in stage 16, a set launch price of $0.35171, and $2 projections, the case for early involvement is strong. Anyone researching the top crypto to buy in 2025 should consider that Cold Wallet is already active, rewarding, and still flying under the radar. The real question is who will recognise its utility before it hits wider adoption.

2025-08-02 17:30:00,49433625,1754155800,"Cold Wallet, ENA, PENGU, & LTC: The Top Crypto Assets Everyone’s Rushing Into This Month","Some coins are popping just from the buzz. But others? They’re moving because they’ve built real momentum. With crypto markets turning up again, it’s not just hype that’s winning; it’s the tokens with actual use cases. While the noise gets louder, a few names are quietly pulling in volume and fresh attention fast. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) is flipping the script on wallets. ENA is gaining serious traction in DeFi. PENGU’s got its meme power dialed in with strong buying pressure. LTC is showing it’s still got a major role in real-world transfers. These are the top crypto assets gaining ground right now. Here’s why buyers are jumping in before prices run higher. 1. Cold Wallet: A Live Wallet That Actually Pays You Cold Wallet isn’t just selling a dream; it’s already working. This wallet rewards every move you make with CWT. Gas? Swap? Ramp? You get cashback for it. And the more CWT you hold, the more rewards you earn. Diamond tier users can get up to 100% cashback on gas and 50% on swaps, no staking, no waiting. It’s live now and delivering daily. The presale price? Just $0.00942. That’s the floor, its confirmed listing price is $0.35171, and it’s expected to hit over $2 as adoption builds. That’s over 212x potential from this early stage. The presale spans 150 price stages, and 40% of the total supply is allocated here. Another 25% is locked for ongoing user rewards. Plus, you get a 10% referral bonus in CWT when you share it, and your invitees get 5% too. This isn’t just another coin; it’s a working product with built-in value on every action. That’s why Cold Wallet is topping the list of top crypto assets to get into now. With the price still at $0.00942, the window to move early is still wide open. 2. PENGU: Meme Energy With Real Momentum PENGU is no longer just a meme; it’s moving with purpose. Priced near $0.000186, it’s all over crypto feeds thanks to real volume and active buyers. Coordinated campaigns, burns, and steady community pushes have kept it in the spotlight and built serious pressure under the chart. What makes PENGU stand out right now? It’s consistent. Where other meme coins fade fast, PENGU is rolling out updates, building a roadmap, and teasing features like staking and community games. That combo of low price and strong engagement is drawing in meme traders looking for something with staying power. It’s earned a spot among the top crypto assets by turning hype into movement. 3. ENA: DeFi Traction That’s Picking Up Speed Ethena (ENA) is grabbing attention across DeFi, and the price is starting to reflect that shift. It’s trading at around $0.64, with steady upward momentum thanks to growing use of its synthetic dollar and staking tools. With capital-efficient yield strategies, ENA appeals to both big and small DeFi users. That’s keeping the volume up and the chart trending. What’s helping ENA move fast is its expanding reach, new integrations with key protocols and exchanges are placing it right in the center of DeFi’s rebound. Its total value locked (TVL) has surged in the past month. This isn’t a flash-in-the-pan project. ENA is retaining users and pulling in new capital. Even without cashback features, the price trend alone makes it one of this month’s top crypto assets worth watching. 4. LTC: Not Flashy, But Still Moving Big Money Litecoin (LTC) is showing why older coins shouldn’t be counted out. It’s currently trading around $93 and aiming to break back above $100. Recent jumps in activity show it’s still a go-to for cross-border payments and fast, low-fee transfers. It may not dominate headlines, but its usage numbers say plenty. What keeps LTC relevant? Reliability. While meme tokens rise and fall, LTC stays in the game with consistent speed and confirmed network performance. And now that transaction volumes are on the rise across crypto, LTC is seeing a bump in real usage. It may not promise wild gains, but for many traders, that stability makes it one of the top crypto assets to keep in rotation this cycle. These Projects Are Rising for Real Reasons Each coin here is gaining traction not from speculation, but from real use, real upgrades, and growing activity. SHIB and PEPE may light up meme feeds, but Cold Wallet, ENA, PENGU, and LTC are giving buyers more to work with. From cashback systems to DeFi tools, community growth, and dependable utility, these projects are delivering. Cold Wallet leads the charge by turning crypto fees into rewards, all while priced at just $0.00942. ENA is turning heads in the DeFi space. PENGU is proving that memes with structure can run. LTC is showing that classic coins still drive value. If you’re eyeing the top crypto assets to move into before the next breakout, this list offers a powerful mix of early access and proven delivery.

2025-08-02 17:10:10,49431208,1754154610,Anthropic’s Bold Move: Revoking OpenAI’s Claude AI Access,"BitcoinWorld Anthropic’s Bold Move: Revoking OpenAI’s Claude AI Access In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovation and rivalry often go hand-in-hand, a significant development has sent ripples across the industry. Leading AI firm Anthropic has made a decisive move, reportedly revoking access for its competitor, OpenAI , to its advanced Claude AI models. This action, stemming from alleged violations of Anthropic’s terms of service, highlights the intensifying AI competition and raises crucial questions about data usage, proprietary technology, and the future trajectory of foundational AI models like GPT-5 . What Sparked the Dispute? Unpacking Anthropic’s Stance The core of this escalating dispute, as reported by Wired, centers on how OpenAI was allegedly utilizing Anthropic’s Claude AI models. Sources indicate that OpenAI had been integrating Claude into its internal tools. This integration reportedly allowed OpenAI to benchmark Claude’s performance against its own proprietary models across various critical categories, including coding, writing, and safety protocols. For Anthropic , this was a direct breach of their commercial terms, which explicitly prohibit companies from leveraging Claude to develop competing services. An Anthropic spokesperson elaborated on their position, stating, “OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5 .” This particular detail suggests a strategic move by OpenAI to gain insights into a rival’s capabilities, potentially informing the development of their next-generation model. Such competitive intelligence gathering, while common in many industries, crosses a line when it violates contractual agreements designed to protect intellectual property and market advantage. OpenAI’s Response: A Glimpse into the Future of AI Competition In response to Anthropic’s decision, an OpenAI spokesperson expressed disappointment, noting, “While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.” This statement underscores the complex dynamics of the AI ecosystem, where companies are both competitors and, at times, reluctant collaborators through API access. OpenAI’s sentiment suggests a desire for continued reciprocal access, perhaps for their own benchmarking or research purposes, even as they develop their own powerful models. This incident is not an isolated one in the history of AI competition . It echoes previous instances where Anthropic has shown reluctance to provide access to competitors. Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan previously justified cutting off Windsurf (a rumored OpenAI acquisition target, later acquired by Cognition) by remarking, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” This consistent stance highlights Anthropic’s commitment to protecting its technological edge and preventing direct competitive exploitation of its models. The Core of the Conflict: Terms of Service and the Race for GPT-5 The crux of the matter lies in the delicate balance between open innovation and proprietary protection. While many AI companies offer API access to foster development and expand their reach, they also embed strict terms of service to prevent misuse, especially by direct competitors. Anthropic’s terms are clear: using Claude AI to build competing services is forbidden. OpenAI’s alleged actions, particularly in the context of their impending GPT-5 launch, appear to have directly contravened these terms. This situation brings to light several critical aspects: Proprietary Technology vs. Open Access: The tension between making powerful AI models accessible via API and safeguarding core intellectual property from competitive exploitation. Benchmarking Ethics: The ethical boundaries of using a competitor’s product for internal benchmarking, especially when it might inform the development of a directly competing product. The Race for Next-Gen Models: The fierce urgency among leading AI labs to develop and launch superior models like GPT-5 , driving intense competitive behavior. This incident serves as a stark reminder that as AI capabilities advance, so too will the complexities of business relationships, legal frameworks, and ethical considerations within the industry. Implications for the AI Landscape: What’s Next for Claude AI and OpenAI? The immediate consequence is a potential reduction in data points for OpenAI’s internal comparisons, which might slightly impact their development insights. However, the broader implications extend beyond just these two companies. This dispute sets a precedent for how major AI players might interact and protect their innovations going forward. It could lead to: Stricter API Terms: Other AI providers might review and tighten their API access terms to prevent similar situations. Increased Internal Development: Companies might invest more heavily in developing their own comprehensive internal benchmarking tools and less on relying on competitor APIs. Consolidation or Divergence: The industry could see further consolidation through acquisitions (like Cognition acquiring Windsurf) or a more pronounced divergence, with companies building walled gardens around their unique AI capabilities. For developers and businesses relying on these powerful models, such disputes highlight the importance of understanding the underlying terms of service and diversifying their AI toolchains to mitigate risks associated with sudden access revocations. Conclusion: A New Chapter in AI Competition The decision by Anthropic to revoke OpenAI ‘s access to its Claude AI models marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing AI competition . It underscores the intense rivalry driving innovation in the sector and the lengths to which companies will go to protect their competitive advantages. As the race to develop increasingly sophisticated models like GPT-5 accelerates, we can expect more such strategic maneuvers and legal skirmishes. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that the future of AI is not just about technological breakthroughs, but also about the complex interplay of business strategy, intellectual property, and ethical conduct. The AI landscape is maturing, and with that maturity comes a heightened awareness of commercial realities and competitive boundaries.

However, while the broader altcoin market faces headwinds, a wave of optimism is quietly building around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol capturing trader attention for its real-world asset lending infrastructure. Over 14,700 investors have already put their money in the project, with Mutuum Finance having raised more than $13.8 million so far. The project is currently at Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, an increase of 16.67% from Presale Phase 5. The upcoming Phase 7 will also see a price increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Investors are now able to reap a 71.43% ROI when the token launches at $0.06. As ADA navigates technical resistance zones and the market recalibrates, savvy investors are starting to position for a potential breakout with Mutuum Finance, hinting at a strategic rotation in capital within the crypto market. Cardano (ADA) slides below $0.78 support amid bearish signals Cardano is currently trading at $0.78, having dropped from recent highs near $0.90 as momentum waned and a bearish head-and-shoulders reversal pattern materialized, signaling potential downward pressure toward $0.67–$0.70 if support does not hold. Despite the setback, technical outlooks remain mixed: while some models identify a short-term target within $0.75–$0.80, others suggest that a break below $0.78 could lead to deeper consolidation or further correction in Cardano’s price. As ADA navigates this critical zone, market focus is increasingly shifting toward emerging utility-driven DeFi tokens like Mutuum Finance. Dual-lending system by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an active and passive users’ lending platform in DeFi. Passive income is generated from lending USDT in stable passive income-generating smart contract pools. Aside from that, MUTM allows lenders and borrowers to swap as much as they want with no intermediaries. That is usually the case with users who deal with less stable assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale now live Following the complete sell-out of its Phase 5 presale, Mutuum Finance has brought online Phase 6, and the tokens are now priced at $0.035, which represents a rise of 16.17% from the previous round. The next price cap is $0.04, a 14.29% rise. Earliest investors at this level may realize a 71.43% return once MUTM is trading at $0.06. To date, the presale has raised over $13.8 million and attracted over 14,700 distinct investors, which speaks volumes about the project’s growing popularity. Secured by CertiK and a $50K bug bounty program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Aside from that, the project is certified by CertiK with a 95.0 trust score. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty.

Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of weakness, trading below $0.78 with bearish pressure mounting. As ADA struggles to hold support, investors are rotating into high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently priced at $0.035 in Presale Phase 6, MUTM will rise 14.29% to $0.04 in the next stage. The token launches at $0.06, locking in a 71.43% ROI for current buyers.

Bitcoin dominance is rising, sending pressure across the altcoin market. Analyst says August could define Ethereum’s path for the year. The crypto market is sending mixed signals. Despite earlier hopes for an altcoin season, Bitcoin dominance in this cycle is rising, which usually means trouble for small-cap altcoins. While a few altcoins might do well, the overall altcoin market has shown signs of weakness. So while broader altcoins face pressure from BTC’s dominance, altcoin leader Ethereum still has a shot to flip the script. Related: Bitcoin Dominance Hits 3-Year High But Faces Historical August-September Slump Ethereum’s Make-or-Break Test in August Analyst Benjamin Cowen said that August will be a decisive month for Ethereum. If Ethereum can break above $4,000 soon, it could trigger a strong rally by the end of the year.

The cybersecurity firm Zimperium says the so-called DoubleTrouble trojan “has rapidly evolved in both its distribution methods and capabilities,” and is now permeating channels on the social platform Discord. “In its latest evolution, the malware has integrated several new and advanced features, significantly expanding its capabilities beyond earlier iterations. These enhancements enable more effective data theft, device manipulation, and evasion techniques. The new functionalities include: displaying malicious UI overlays to steal PIN codes or unlock patterns, comprehensive screen recording capabilities, the ability to block the opening of specific applications, and advanced keylogging functionality.” Researchers say the malware convinces users to download it by masking itself as an extension or an add-on, and it uses the Google Play icon to appear trustworthy. It also manipulates device functionality by exploiting Android’s Accessibility Services, allowing it to block legitimate banking or security apps with misleading “system maintenance” prompts. In addition, the malicious software simulates user actions like taps and swipes, allowing attackers to remotely control infected devices and steal data, including passwords and banking details, with alarming precision. The trojan’s attacks are ongoing, primarily targeting users in Europe through phishing websites and Discord-hosted APKs. Specific victim counts remain unknown at time of publishing.

2025-08-02 07:00:32,49405797,1754118032,"Live Crypto Price Prediction: XRP, ADA, XLM","With the crypto market entering a new phase of consolidation, investors are watching closely to see whether leading altcoins can resume their uptrend. XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM) have all seen strong rallies in recent weeks—but the question now is whether that momentum can continue. At the same time, early buyers are turning attention to newer, lower-cap opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is gaining traction for its aggressive growth pace and expanding user base, with analysts suggesting a potential upside of 37x once it hits key listings. XRP Eyes Rebound After $3.55 High XRP’s recent climb to $3.55 was followed by a correction to $3.12, where it is currently consolidating. Despite the pullback, whale accumulation continues. Many analysts believe a breakout could occur if ETF approval rumors resurface. Price Prediction: XRP could trade between $3.00 and $4.75 in the coming weeks, with upside hinging on regulatory catalysts and volume recovery. Early-Stage Frenzy Builds Anticipation MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract speculative attention. Insider reports suggest new rounds are closing within hours, as buyers aim to lock in early allocations. Some projections place the potential ROI as high as 37x , making it one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this quarter. If momentum continues through launch and listings, the token could be the next frontier of the altcoin season. ADA Forecast Looks Strong into Protocol Launch Cardano currently trades around $0.76, still significantly below its previous all-time high. With the Midnight protocol and ecosystem updates approaching, long-term buyers are beginning to accumulate. Price Prediction: ADA could revisit the $1.00–$1.20 range in Q3, with room to move higher if network growth accelerates. Stellar Holds Steady After Rapid Climb Stellar (XLM) surged to $0.55 in July before correcting to its current level of $0.41. RSI remains neutral, showing indecision—but some expect renewed movement if broader market sentiment improves. Price Prediction: If support holds, XLM may test the $0.48–$0.52 range, while a drop below $0.39 could open downside to $0.33. Conclusion XRP, ADA, and XLM are showing signs of stabilization after recent rallies, with traders watching key support and resistance levels. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as the breakout opportunity, with forecasts of up to 37x returns for early participants—fueling growing demand during its early stages.

Bitcoin Price Just Made A Low Under $115,000 Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market has witnessed a wave of bearish momentum during the past day as prices across the coins have declined. BTC went into the low $114,000 levels earlier in the day, but the coin has since bounced back above $115,000. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Here? 6 Key Metrics Show Market Shift The below chart shows how the asset’s recent performance has looked. Last week, BTC also dropped toward the $115,000 mark, but back then, it was able to quickly bounce back to resume sideways movement around $118,000. As such, it only remains to be seen whether the current deviation is a temporary one as well or if it’s the start of a real break away from the consolidation range. Most of the altcoins have taken a worse hit than the number one cryptocurrency during the past day, with some like Solana (SOL) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) exceeding losses of 5%. Crypto Derivatives Market Has Racked Up Large Liquidations A consequence of the market-wide volatility has been that liquidations have piled up over at the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector, according to data from CoinGlass. Below is a table that shows the numbers related to the latest market liquidations. As is visible above, a total of $804 million in cryptocurrency contracts have found liquidation during the past day. Out of these, $741 million of the contracts, equivalent to 92% of the total, were longs. Ethereum (ETH) led the derivatives flush with $250 million in liquidations, Bitcoin followed at $200 million. ETH topping the sector in this metric over BTC is likely a combination of two factors: its price has seen a steeper decline in the last 24 hours and speculative interest around it has been elevated due to the earlier breakout. Signs were already there that a volatile liquidation event may be coming. As this chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn on Wednesday shows, the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest was sharply climbing. The “Aggregated Open Interest” here naturally refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to BTC that are open on all centralized exchanges.

2025-08-02 06:55:11,49405435,1754117711,Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer’s Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer’s Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and few areas capture attention quite like Bitcoin mining . It’s the engine that powers the entire Bitcoin network, creating new coins and validating transactions. Recently, a significant player in this space, Bitdeer, shared some exciting news that highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset accumulation. This development offers a fascinating glimpse into the operations of large-scale miners and their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. Bitdeer, a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) cloud mining company, recently announced via X that it successfully mined a total of 63.1 BTC over the past week. This achievement not only demonstrates their operational efficiency but also provides valuable insight into their strategic asset management. The firm also sold 26.8 BTC during the same period, indicating a thoughtful approach to balancing liquidity with long-term holdings. Consequently, Bitdeer’s pure holdings have increased by 36.4 BTC, bringing their total to an impressive 1,637.8 BTC. This growth underscores the ongoing profitability and strategic importance of professional Bitcoin mining operations. What is Bitcoin Mining and How Does Bitdeer Excel? For those new to the crypto world, you might be wondering: what exactly is Bitcoin mining ? At its core, it is the process by which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation, and new transactions are added to the blockchain. This process involves powerful computers solving complex computational puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. It’s a critical function that ensures the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Bitdeer operates primarily as a cloud mining service. What does this mean? Instead of individuals buying and maintaining expensive mining hardware, they can purchase ‘hash rate’ from companies like Bitdeer. This allows them to participate in Bitcoin mining without the complexities of managing equipment, electricity costs, or cooling systems. Bitdeer leverages its vast infrastructure, advanced mining rigs, and optimized energy solutions to perform mining operations on a large scale. Their expertise in managing these complex systems allows them to achieve consistent mining outputs, as evidenced by their recent 63.1 BTC weekly haul. This model democratizes access to mining while centralizing the operational heavy lifting. Bitdeer’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: A Deep Dive into Growth Bitdeer’s recent report isn’t just about the quantity of Bitcoin mined; it also reveals a strategic approach to managing their digital assets. Mining 63.1 BTC in a week is a significant feat, but their decision to sell 26.8 BTC alongside this achievement provides a clearer picture of their operational strategy. This balancing act of accumulating new assets while liquidating a portion can be crucial for covering operational expenses, reinvesting in infrastructure, or managing market exposure. It reflects a sophisticated financial management strategy typical of large-scale crypto enterprises. The net increase of 36.4 BTC to their pure holdings, bringing the total to 1,637.8 BTC, demonstrates a clear long-term accumulation strategy. This indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and a commitment to growing their digital asset reserves. Understanding these movements is key to appreciating the financial health and strategic direction of a major Bitcoin mining entity. Let’s look at a simplified breakdown of their recent activity: Activity Amount (BTC) Impact on Holdings BTC Mined This Week 63.1 Increase BTC Sold This Week 26.8 Decrease Net Increase in Holdings 36.4 Positive Current Total Holdings 1,637.8 Accumulated This table illustrates the company’s dynamic management of its mined assets, highlighting a strategy that balances immediate needs with long-term accumulation. Such transparency from a major player like Bitdeer offers valuable data points for market analysts and investors. The Broader Impact of Robust Bitcoin Mining Operations The consistent success of large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Bitdeer has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Firstly, it contributes to the overall security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. The more miners there are, and the more robust their operations, the more secure the network becomes against potential attacks. Secondly, their operational scale influences the market dynamics. While mining introduces new supply, the strategic holding patterns of major miners can also impact market sentiment and available supply for trading. Furthermore, the growth of companies like Bitdeer drives innovation in the mining sector. This includes advancements in energy efficiency, the development of more powerful mining hardware, and the exploration of sustainable energy sources for mining. As the industry matures, the focus on environmental impact becomes more pronounced, pushing miners towards greener solutions. Bitdeer, like many other large players, is increasingly investing in renewable energy projects to power their operations, aligning with global sustainability goals. This shift is vital for the long-term viability and public perception of Bitcoin mining . The profitability of Bitcoin mining is also closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, as well as the network’s difficulty adjustment and the block reward halving events. With the recent halving, the block reward for miners was cut in half, making operational efficiency and strategic asset management even more critical for profitability. Companies like Bitdeer, with their established infrastructure and strong financial position, are better equipped to navigate these changes compared to smaller, less capitalized operations. Their ability to continue mining and accumulating BTC post-halving speaks volumes about their resilience and long-term vision. Challenges and Opportunities in the Bitcoin Mining Landscape While the recent figures from Bitdeer paint a positive picture, the Bitcoin mining industry is not without its challenges. Volatility in Bitcoin’s price directly impacts revenue. Energy costs, regulatory changes, and increasing network difficulty are constant factors that miners must navigate. The competition is fierce, and staying ahead requires continuous investment in technology and infrastructure. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities. The drive for greater energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources are pushing the industry towards a more sustainable future. Innovation in mining hardware continues to improve profitability and reduce operational footprints. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these dynamics is key. The strength of mining operations like Bitdeer can be seen as a barometer for the health and confidence within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Their continued accumulation of BTC signals a strong belief in the asset’s long-term value, providing a layer of stability and institutional backing to the market. The transparency provided by companies like Bitdeer, sharing their mining output and holdings, helps build trust and provides valuable data for market analysis. Conclusion Bitdeer’s recent announcement of mining 63.1 BTC and increasing its pure holdings to over 1,637 BTC highlights the robust and evolving nature of the Bitcoin mining industry. It showcases not only the company’s operational strength but also its strategic approach to asset management in a dynamic market. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the role of large-scale miners like Bitdeer becomes increasingly important in securing the network, driving innovation, and shaping the supply-side economics of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Their ongoing success is a testament to the enduring power and potential of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is cloud mining, and how does Bitdeer fit into it? Cloud mining allows individuals to participate in Bitcoin mining by renting computing power (hash rate) from a mining farm like Bitdeer, rather than owning and operating their own hardware. Bitdeer provides the infrastructure and expertise for large-scale mining operations. Q2: Why did Bitdeer sell some of the Bitcoin they mined? Selling a portion of mined Bitcoin is a common strategic move for mining companies. It helps cover operational costs, invest in new equipment, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market prices while still accumulating a net increase in their holdings. Q3: How does Bitcoin mining impact the Bitcoin network? Bitcoin mining is crucial for the network’s security and functionality. Miners validate transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new bitcoins. This process maintains the integrity and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Q4: What are the main challenges for Bitcoin mining companies today? Key challenges include the volatile price of Bitcoin, rising energy costs, increasing network difficulty (making mining harder), and evolving regulatory landscapes. The recent Bitcoin halving also significantly reduced block rewards, increasing pressure on profitability. Q5: How does Bitdeer’s accumulation of BTC affect the market? When large entities like Bitdeer accumulate significant amounts of BTC, it can signal long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Their strategic holding patterns can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially influencing market dynamics and sentiment. Q6: Is Bitcoin mining becoming more environmentally friendly? Yes, there is a growing trend towards more sustainable Bitcoin mining. Many large mining operations, including Bitdeer, are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources like hydro, solar, and wind power to reduce their carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency.

This has prompted project proponents and analysts to ask who is selling at such adverse times for the underlying asset’s price. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko It’s safe to say that the past few days have been quite painful for the entire cryptocurrency industry, with more than $250 billion evaporating from the total market cap. Bitcoin’s price tumbled to multi-week lows of under $113,000, while many altcoins have crashed by 5-10%. However, Pi Network’s native token has taken this correction even worse. Pi has slumped by 16% in the past day alone, and more than 30% monthly. As a result, it plunged to a new all-time low today at $0.34 (on CoinGecko), which broke the previous anti-record from yesterday. On some exchanges, the price slump was even more profound, prompting analysts like Moon Jeff to ask who is selling at such low levels. $PI broke below its previous low at 40 cents. Now at 0.32. I wonder who is still selling coins now. #Pinetwork pic.twitter.com/2nKUvv7LdL — MOON JEFF (@CRYPTOAD00) August 2, 2025 This price crash occurred after a massive token unlock period for Pi, in which the total daily number of freed coins frequently exceeded 10 million. Data from PiScan shows that there could be some relief in the near future. The token unlocks are set to be reduced in the next month, as only two days will see more than 7.5 million coins released. The average for the next month will be at 5.3 million, which is a lot fewer than the 7+ million in June and July. This could reduce the immediate selling pressure for Pi and perhaps stop the freefalls, at least for the time being. PI Token Unlock Schedule.

2025-08-02 06:32:13,49423635,1754116333,"Here is How High Shiba Inu Must Rise for SHIB to Clinch 3rd, 4th, or 5th Place in Crypto Rankings","Optimism about Shiba Inu’s potential push into the top five crypto rankings has been reignited as large investors indicate interest in SHIB. The broader Shiba Inu community eagerly anticipates SHIB’s potential ascent into the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Momentum behind this goal has surged since November 2024, when lead developer Shytoshi Kusama unveiled plans to propel SHIB into the top five rankings. Shiba Inu Lead's Ambitious Aspiration As previously reported , the Shiba Inu lead referenced an AI-generated painting depicting a man conducting research at a cluttered desk overflowing with books. Commenting, Kusama noted that it reflects how he tries to use a small budget to give SHIB utility and take the token to the top five crypto rankings in less than five years. It’s been nine months since Kusama shared this aspiration, and SHIB has dropped from the 13th position, where it sat at the time, to the 22nd place. Nonetheless, some enthusiasts have remained optimistic about SHIB’s potential to break into the crypto top five. This optimism has soared lately as large holders shift huge amounts of tokens from exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Last month, two unlabeled blockchain addresses withdrew 5 trillion SHIB and 110.34 billion tokens from Coinbase and Binance, respectively. For context, cracking the top 5 would place SHIB among the five largest cryptocurrencies in the world. This could see SHIB rank as either the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Growth Required to Position SHIB in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th Crypto Rankings Despite sitting in the 22nd position, we explored how high the token must rise to ascend to the third, fourth, or fifth place in the global crypto ranking. Notably, Shiba Inu is still trying to stage a rebound after reacting negatively to Trump’s new tariff plan, which sent it crashing below $0.000012. However, SHIB has rebounded above $0.000012 and currently trades at $0.000012, translating to a market cap of $7.2 billion. Currently, XRP, USDT, and BNB occupy the third, fourth, and fifth spots with market caps of $178.48 billion, $163.85 billion, and $106.99 billion, respectively. For Shiba Inu to claim the third place and potentially overtake XRP, its market cap would need to surge approximately 2,386% to about $179 billion. Similarly, elevating SHIB into the fourth slot and usurping USDT would require a 2,177% increase to $164 billion, and cracking the top five by surpassing BNB would demand a 1,400% climb to $108 billion. If Shiba Inu’s supply remains stable at 589 trillion tokens, achieving valuations of $108 billion, $164 billion, or $179 billion would propel SHIB’s price to $0.000183, $0.000278, or $0.000303, respectively. ChatGPT Insights on Projections According to ChatGPT, Shiba Inu’s potential surge to these targets is within the realm of possibility. The AI chatbot speculated that SHIB will attain the $0.000183 target over the next six months or by February 2026, potentially driven by a strong altcoin season. It speculated that it would take within 1 - 3 years for the asset to reach a price range of $0.000278 - $0.000303. ChatGPT believes that SHIB would require a historic bull run and breakthroughs to achieve these targets. ChatGPT forecast for SHIB rally ChatGPT forecast for SHIB rally Despite the bullish projection, caution is still required, given the volatility of the crypto market. Shiba Inu’s potential ascent to the third, fourth, or fifth place in the global crypto ranking could be hindered by the lack of institutional interest in the token. Shiba Inu has yet to get a single filing for a spot-based ETF, unlike other meme-based tokens, such as Dogecoin and Official Trump. Speculation suggests that the anonymous nature of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem team may be discouraging institutions from engaging with SHIB like other meme-based tokens.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,1,optimism shiba inu potential push top five crypto ranking reignited large investor indicate interest shib broader shiba inu community eagerly anticipates shib potential ascent top five cryptocurrencies market capitalization momentum behind goal surged since november lead developer shytoshi kusama unveiled plan propel shib top five ranking shiba inu lead ambitious aspiration previously reported shiba inu lead referenced painting depicting man conducting research cluttered desk overflowing book commenting kusama noted reflects try use small budget give shib utility take token top five crypto ranking less five year nine month since kusama shared aspiration shib dropped position sat time place nonetheless enthusiast remained optimistic shib potential break crypto top five optimism soared lately large holder shift huge amount token exchange like coinbase binance last month two unlabeled blockchain address withdrew trillion shib billion token coinbase binance respectively context cracking top would place shib among five largest cryptocurrencies world could see shib rank either first second third fourth cryptocurrency market cap growth required position shib crypto ranking despite sitting position explored high token must rise ascend third fourth fifth place global crypto ranking notably shiba inu still trying stage rebound reacting negatively trump new tariff plan sent crashing however shib rebounded currently trade translating market cap billion currently xrp usdt bnb occupy third fourth fifth spot market cap billion billion billion respectively shiba inu claim third place potentially overtake xrp market cap would need surge approximately billion similarly elevating shib fourth slot usurping usdt would require increase billion cracking top five surpassing bnb would demand climb billion shiba inu supply remains stable trillion token achieving valuation billion billion billion would propel shib price respectively chatgpt insight projection according chatgpt shiba inu potential surge target within realm possibility ai chatbot speculated shib attain target next six month february potentially driven strong altcoin season speculated would take within year asset reach price range chatgpt belief shib would require historic bull run breakthrough achieve target chatgpt forecast shib rally chatgpt forecast shib rally despite bullish projection caution still required given volatility crypto market shiba inu potential ascent third fourth fifth place global crypto ranking could hindered lack institutional interest token shiba inu yet get single filing etf unlike token dogecoin official trump speculation suggests anonymous nature shiba inu ecosystem team may discouraging institution engaging shib like token,0.023,0.796,0.181,0.9955,1

2025-08-02 06:30:30,49404489,1754116230,Crypto Insiders Say One Move Now Could Change Everything by September,"As the SEC rolls out its Project Crypto initiative – a landmark regulatory overhaul designed to support tokenized securities, DeFi integration, and streamlined issuance—many crypto insiders are pointing to September as a pivotal turning point . Analysts expect clear definitions and guidelines may unlock institutional and retail flows previously held back. In this landscape, investors are watching for projects that can merge momentum with structural credibility. One such emerging token increasingly mentioned in this circle—and appearing on trusted ledger lists – is MAGACOIN FINANCE, now riding peak visibility amid security validation and audit-backed trust. Why September may mark a structural shift in crypto trust Media reports and industry commentary suggest the SEC’s policy change is more than technical – it’s symbolic . By shifting toward supportive frameworks around token classifications, staking, and digital-ledger security, the agency may offer renewed confidence to institutions now positioning for regulatory clarity. As insiders pivot capital in anticipation, timing and trust credentials become critical entry points. High on credibility and trust metrics Unlike many early-stage altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a perfect 10/10 TrustScore from independent auditors – based on transparent tokenomics, fixed supply, verified smart contracts. Complementing this, the project has passed a full smart contract audit, with no critical vulnerabilities identified and structural integrity confirmed. Analysts consistently highlight its governance and public verification as rare strengths in the meme-token space. As regulations evolve, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a model case of early-stage altcoins built on structural transparency and audit-backed security. How these dynamics shape tactical investor decisions Historically, crypto cycles reward those who enter when both regulatory clarity and project legitimacy are aligning—before mainstream entry floods in. If September does usher in crypto-friendly policy, projects with public trust credentials and early technical validation are likely to outperform . Tokens that combine visible demand, audit transparency, and time-sensitive access often become the breakout candidates. MAGACOIN FINANCE now fits that profile—with its latest audit bolstering investor confidence in this critical phase. Conclusion: Timing, trust, and transparency converge Crypto insiders are eyeing the SEC’s reforms as a potential watershed moment – one that may change the playing field for early – stage assets . MAGACOIN FINANCE, fortified by independent audit ratings and TrustScore excellence, stands out as a token aligning momentum with legitimacy. Whether regulators deliver or not, the message is clear: when structural trust , audit credentials, and early visibility coincide, the long – term opportunity often follows.

The mission? Becoming the first token in the world that everybody holds, no matter their background, wealth, or level of crypto knowledge. What began as a bold experiment in fair tokenomics has evolved into a movement backed by data, unwavering community support, and unmatched staying power. HOLD sets out to be the Bitcoin on Ethereum, acting as a primary store of value with no one wallet owning more than 0.58% of the supply. Built Different from Day One At launch, HOLD introduced a revolutionary mechanism that took the entire market by surprise: no one could buy more than a tiny sliver of the supply. The buy limit increased slowly, eliminating early bot abuse and whale dominance. This approach inspired countless imitators, but none could match HOLD’s balance of fairness and organic growth. Then, the developer took it a step further—first buying 72.22% of the total supply with his own funds, and then burning it (see Etherscan ). The result: no central supply, no major dumps, and no future dilution. What remains is pure scarcity, controlled entirely by the retail investors. Backed by the Community, Not VC Money HOLD is a community takeover (CTO) project with no developer wallet or team wallet. The project is entirely community owned. From crypto veterans like Paddy (known for early calls on SHIB and Telcoin) and WIZZ , to community members grinding in X Spaces and IRL sticker warriors all over the world, $HOLD is powered by real people—not insiders or VCs. That means no VC wallets, no airdrops, and no token unlocks. HOLD’s grassroots movement continues to grow, with nearly 2,000 new holders in the last 90 days alone. Impeccable strength and tenure Having survived 660 days in the crypto trenches proves the strength of HOLD and its community. In this time, HOLD has survived three 80%+ pullbacks. This is significant and stands as a milestone in the crypto community, and the holder base has changed from early adopters to diehard believers. HOLD has achieved what many projects only dream of, and is primed for its next stage as we head into the strongest crypto bull market the world has ever seen, with a chart that calls to mind similar projects like SPX, SHIB, and DOGE, only with much greater upside potential. Soon Everybody Will Hold The mission of HOLD is simple but powerful: Everybody Will Hold. Everybody in crypto, then eventually everybody on Earth. Already, the community is spreading the word in over 40 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. With its unrivaled distribution and supply dynamics, HOLD has become a universal symbol of fairness, community, and shared opportunity in crypto. Now Live on Base With a new deployment on the Base chain, HOLD begins its next chapter. Faster and less expensive transactions bring accessibility to a new wave of holders, without compromising the original mission. Both smart contracts are now live: ETH Contract: 0x68b36248477277865c64dfc78884ef80577078f3 BASE Contract: 0x9493c825f691f272ce12b0d001b746130629bf71 HOLD Stats (July 2025) Price: $0.0093 Market Cap: $25.7M Holders: 4490 Circ.

2025-08-02 06:25:10,49404180,1754115910,BTC Long-Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Insights for Smarter Futures Trading,"BitcoinWorld BTC Long-Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Insights for Smarter Futures Trading In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, understanding market sentiment is paramount. For Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures, one of the most revealing indicators is the BTC long-short ratio . This metric offers a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate a price increase (long) or a decrease (short). It is not just a number; it is a pulse check of the market’s collective conviction, a tool that can empower traders to make more informed decisions. By analyzing these ratios, we can gain valuable insights into potential market movements and identify shifts in investor psychology. What Exactly Is the BTC Long-Short Ratio? The BTC long-short ratio is a simple yet powerful indicator that reflects the proportion of long positions versus short positions on a given cryptocurrency exchange for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative product that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. Long Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will increase. They profit if the price goes up. Short Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will decrease. They profit if the price goes down. The Ratio Calculation: The ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of long positions by the total number or volume of short positions. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 indicates more short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment. Our data presents it as percentages for easier understanding. This ratio provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among leveraged traders. When a significant majority of traders are leaning one way, it can sometimes signal an impending reversal, as extreme positioning often precedes a shift in market direction. Decoding the Daily BTC Long-Short Ratio Landscape Let us examine the recent 24-hour BTC long-short ratio data for Bitcoin perpetual futures across several prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. This data offers immediate insight into current market positioning: Metric Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Across Exchanges 48.22% 51.78% Binance 48.05% 51.95% Bybit 47.12% 52.88% Gate.io 49.96% 50.04% As observed from the table, the aggregated data indicates a slight dominance of short positions, with 51.78% of traders leaning bearish compared to 48.22% leaning bullish. This suggests a cautious or slightly negative sentiment among futures traders over the past 24 hours. Individual exchange data largely mirrors this trend, with Bybit showing the strongest bearish bias and Gate.io exhibiting a near-even split, indicating diverse sentiment across platforms. This collective positioning is a key aspect of understanding the current market mood regarding the BTC long-short ratio . Why Do These BTC Long-Short Ratios Matter for Your Trading Strategy? Understanding the BTC long-short ratio is not just an academic exercise; it provides practical utility for your trading strategy. This metric offers several benefits for traders looking to gain an edge in the volatile crypto market: Sentiment Gauge: The most direct application is as a sentiment indicator. A high percentage of long positions suggests optimism, while a high percentage of short positions indicates pessimism. This can help confirm or contradict your own market bias. Contrarian Signals: Extreme imbalances in the ratio can sometimes act as contrarian signals. For instance, if the ratio shows an overwhelming number of long positions, it might suggest that the market is overextended, and a correction or reversal could be imminent. Similarly, an excessive number of short positions might indicate a potential short squeeze or bounce. Liquidation Risk Assessment: When one side of the market is heavily leveraged, it creates a pool of potential liquidations. If the price moves against the majority, these liquidations can trigger cascading effects, leading to rapid price swings. Monitoring the BTC long-short ratio can help anticipate such volatility. Confirmation Tool: The ratio can be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and on-chain data to confirm trading signals. For example, if a chart pattern suggests a bullish breakout, and the long-short ratio is also increasing, it could provide stronger conviction for a long trade. Challenges and Nuances in Interpreting BTC Long-Short Ratios While the BTC long-short ratio is a valuable tool, it is not without its complexities and limitations. A nuanced understanding is crucial to avoid misinterpretations: Data Aggregation Issues: The data often comes from various exchanges, and not all platforms provide transparent or real-time ratio information. Aggregated data, while useful, might not capture the full picture of the entire market. Context is Paramount: The ratio should never be used in isolation. It must be analyzed alongside other key metrics such as funding rates, open interest, price action, and broader macroeconomic factors. A high long ratio during a strong uptrend might be healthy, whereas the same ratio during a consolidation phase could signal a top. Whale Influence: Large institutional traders or ‘whales’ can significantly skew the ratio with their substantial positions. Their motives might differ from retail traders, and their positioning could be part of a larger strategy not immediately apparent from the ratio alone. Short-Term Focus: The 24-hour BTC long-short ratio primarily reflects short-term sentiment. While useful for day traders, it might not provide significant insights for long-term investors. Longer timeframes or aggregated historical data might be needed for broader trend analysis. Lagging vs. Leading Indicator: In some scenarios, the ratio can be a lagging indicator, reflecting what has already happened. In others, particularly at extremes, it can be a leading indicator of potential reversals. Discerning this requires experience and careful observation. Actionable Insights: Leveraging BTC Long-Short Ratios in Your Trading Now that we have explored what the BTC long-short ratio is and its nuances, let us discuss how to practically apply this knowledge to enhance your trading decisions: Identify Extreme Ratios: Pay close attention when the ratio deviates significantly from its historical average or approaches extreme levels (e.g., 70%+ long or 70%+ short). These extremes often precede significant price movements or reversals. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, consider if the market is due for a pullback as ‘fuel’ for short liquidations builds. Combine with Funding Rates: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts are fees paid between long and short positions to keep the contract price close to the spot price. A high positive funding rate combined with a high long-short ratio can indicate an overheated market, making long positions riskier. Conversely, negative funding rates with a high short ratio might suggest a potential short squeeze. Observe Divergences: Look for divergences between the ratio and price action. If Bitcoin’s price is making higher highs, but the BTC long-short ratio is showing a decreasing number of long positions, it could signal weakening bullish momentum or a lack of conviction from new buyers. Risk Management: Use the ratio to inform your risk management. If the market is heavily skewed in one direction, consider reducing your leverage or taking partial profits if you are on the side of the majority. If you are taking a contrarian position, ensure you have tight stop-losses. Track Across Exchanges: While the aggregate ratio is helpful, observe individual exchange ratios as well. Significant differences might indicate localized liquidity or specific trading dynamics on certain platforms. By integrating these actionable insights, traders can move beyond simply observing the BTC long-short ratio to actively using it as a component of a robust trading strategy. The Future of Market Sentiment: What’s Next for BTC Long-Short Ratios? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and so too are the tools and metrics traders use to navigate it. The BTC long-short ratio will continue to be a vital indicator for gauging short-term sentiment and potential market turning points. As the market matures and more sophisticated trading strategies emerge, the interpretation of these ratios may also evolve. The rise of institutional participation, advancements in algorithmic trading, and increasing regulatory clarity could all influence how these ratios behave and what signals they convey. Therefore, continuous learning and adaptation are essential for any trader relying on this metric. Staying informed about broader market trends and technological developments will enhance your ability to effectively utilize the BTC long-short ratio for future trading success. Conclusion The BTC long-short ratio provides a powerful lens through which to view the immediate sentiment of Bitcoin perpetual futures traders. While the recent 24-hour data suggests a slight bearish bias across major exchanges, it is crucial to remember that this metric is most effective when interpreted within a broader context. By understanding its calculation, recognizing its benefits as a sentiment and contrarian indicator, and acknowledging its limitations, traders can integrate this valuable tool into their analytical framework. Employing actionable insights such as identifying extremes, combining with funding rates, and practicing diligent risk management will enable you to leverage the BTC long-short ratio to navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater confidence and precision. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin perpetual future? A Bitcoin perpetual future is a derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. It is designed to track the underlying Bitcoin price closely through a funding rate mechanism. How does the BTC long-short ratio reflect market sentiment? The BTC long-short ratio reflects market sentiment by showing the proportion of traders betting on a price increase (long) versus those betting on a price decrease (short). A higher percentage of long positions indicates bullish sentiment, while a higher percentage of short positions indicates bearish sentiment. Can the BTC long-short ratio predict price movements? While the BTC long-short ratio is a strong indicator of sentiment and can sometimes precede price movements, especially at extreme levels, it is not a standalone predictor. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for more accurate predictions. Why do different exchanges show slightly different BTC long-short ratios? Differences in ratios across exchanges can be due to varying user bases, trading strategies prevalent on each platform, and the specific algorithms or methodologies they use to calculate and present the ratio data. Each exchange has its own unique liquidity and trader demographics. Is a high short ratio always a bad sign for Bitcoin’s price? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates prevailing bearish sentiment, extreme short positioning can sometimes lead to a ‘short squeeze.’ This occurs when the price unexpectedly rises, forcing short sellers to buy back their positions to cover losses, which further fuels the price increase. How often should I check the BTC long-short ratio? The frequency depends on your trading style. For day traders, checking the ratio hourly or every few hours might be beneficial. For swing traders, daily or even weekly checks might suffice to understand broader sentiment shifts.

2025-08-02 06:15:11,49403726,1754115311,ARK Invest Crypto: Cathie Wood’s Astounding Bet on Digital Asset Growth,"BitcoinWorld ARK Invest Crypto: Cathie Wood’s Astounding Bet on Digital Asset Growth The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and leading the charge are firms like ARK Invest, renowned for their visionary approach to disruptive innovation. When we talk about significant moves in this space, especially concerning institutional adoption, the spotlight often turns to ARK Invest crypto strategies. The firm, under the leadership of Cathie Wood, has consistently demonstrated a willingness to invest in areas they believe will shape the future, and cryptocurrency is undoubtedly one such frontier. Recently, ARK Invest made headlines again with another substantial acquisition in the digital asset sector. On August 1st, the firm purchased an additional $29.79 million in Coinbase shares and $17.129 million in Bitmain shares. This latest move, reported by Ark Invest Daily on X, underscores ARK’s unwavering confidence in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It’s a powerful signal that despite market fluctuations, ARK Invest sees fundamental value and growth opportunities within this nascent industry. What’s Behind ARK Invest Crypto’s Latest Strategic Moves? ARK Invest’s investment philosophy centers on identifying and capitalizing on disruptive innovation. Their latest acquisitions in Coinbase (COIN) and Bitmain, though a private entity and accessed likely through specific funds or derivatives given its private status, align perfectly with this core belief. These aren’t just speculative bets; they represent a strategic positioning within key pillars of the crypto economy. Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform in the United States, providing a gateway for millions of users to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Investing in Coinbase offers exposure to the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies, transaction volumes, and the overall growth of the crypto user base. It’s a direct play on the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. Bitmain, on the other hand, is a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining industry, particularly known for its ASIC miners. An investment in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, provides a stake in the foundational infrastructure of various proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. It’s about investing in the hardware that secures and enables these decentralized networks. This dual approach provides diversified exposure to the ARK Invest crypto thesis. To better visualize the scale of these recent acquisitions, consider the breakdown: Company Investment Amount (USD) Role in Crypto Ecosystem Coinbase (COIN) $29.79 Million Leading Crypto Exchange, Custody Services Bitmain $17.129 Million Dominant Crypto Mining Hardware Manufacturer Why is Coinbase a Core Component of ARK Invest Crypto Holdings? Coinbase represents a significant piece of the puzzle for ARK Invest crypto strategy due to several compelling factors. Firstly, as one of the most recognized and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, Coinbase offers a crucial on-ramp for both retail and institutional investors. Its compliance efforts and public listing provide a level of transparency and legitimacy that many other crypto ventures lack, aligning with ARK’s focus on investable innovation. Secondly, Coinbase benefits directly from the network effect of increasing crypto adoption. As more individuals and institutions enter the crypto space, Coinbase’s trading volumes, custody services, and subscription revenues are likely to grow. This positions it as a beneficiary of the overall expansion of the digital asset economy, regardless of which specific cryptocurrencies gain prominence. Furthermore, Coinbase is actively expanding its offerings beyond simple trading, venturing into areas like staking services, institutional custody, and a burgeoning developer ecosystem. This diversification provides multiple avenues for revenue growth and strengthens its position as a foundational player. For ARK Invest, owning Coinbase shares is a strategic bet on the infrastructure of the future digital financial system. How Does Bitmain Complement the ARK Invest Crypto Vision? While Coinbase focuses on the user-facing side of crypto, Bitmain delves into the very foundation of certain digital assets. Bitmain is a powerhouse in the design and manufacturing of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes it a critical player in the security and operation of these decentralized networks. Investing in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, allows ARK Invest to gain exposure to the underlying hardware layer of the crypto industry. This provides a different, yet equally vital, exposure compared to an exchange. It’s a play on the ongoing need for computational power to validate transactions and secure blockchain networks. As Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies continue to operate, the demand for efficient mining hardware persists. This strategic move highlights ARK’s comprehensive view of the crypto market, acknowledging that both the front-end user experience (Coinbase) and the back-end infrastructure (Bitmain) are essential for the long-term viability and growth of the digital asset ecosystem. It demonstrates a holistic understanding of how the ARK Invest crypto portfolio can gain exposure to various critical aspects of the industry. What Are the Broader Implications of ARK Invest Crypto Investments? These consistent investments by ARK Invest, particularly in high-profile companies like Coinbase and key infrastructure providers like Bitmain, send a powerful message to the broader financial market. They signify increasing institutional confidence in the legitimacy and staying power of digital assets. When a firm with the reputation and research capabilities of ARK Invest makes such moves, it often encourages other institutional players to take a closer look. Validation of the Asset Class: ARK’s continued buying reinforces the idea that cryptocurrencies are not just a fleeting trend but a legitimate and evolving asset class with long-term potential. Diversification Strategy: For ARK’s various ETFs, these investments provide diversified exposure to the crypto market beyond simply holding Bitcoin or Ethereum directly. They offer a way to participate in the growth of the infrastructure and service providers. Market Sentiment Influence: Cathie Wood’s pronouncements and ARK’s investment decisions often move markets. Their acquisitions can generate positive sentiment and draw attention to the underlying companies and the crypto sector as a whole. Focus on Innovation: The acquisitions underscore ARK’s commitment to investing in disruptive technologies. They view blockchain and digital assets as fundamental innovations that will reshape various industries. The consistent pattern of these acquisitions by ARK Invest crypto funds suggests a deeply held conviction in the transformative power of decentralized technologies and digital currencies. It’s a long-term vision that looks beyond daily price fluctuations to the fundamental shifts occurring in finance and technology. What Challenges Might ARK Invest Crypto Holdings Face? While ARK Invest’s bullish stance on crypto is clear, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with investing in this volatile sector. No investment is without its hurdles, and digital assets present a unique set: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and by extension, companies whose revenues are tied to them, can experience significant and rapid fluctuations. This volatility can impact the short-to-medium term performance of ARK’s holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains largely undefined in many jurisdictions, including the United States. Changes in regulations could significantly impact companies like Coinbase, affecting their operations, compliance costs, and business models. Competition: The crypto space is highly competitive, with new exchanges, mining operations, and blockchain technologies emerging constantly. This competition could erode market share or profitability for existing players. Technological Risks: While blockchain technology is robust, it’s still evolving. Risks such as security breaches, protocol vulnerabilities, or unexpected technological shifts could impact the entire ecosystem. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate changes, and global liquidity can also influence investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially affecting the performance of ARK Invest crypto assets.

2025-08-02 06:13:09,49403696,1754115189,"An Unusual Proposal Has Been Put Forward for a Surprise Altcoin: If It Happens, It Will Be a First","Phil_00Llama, an active member of CurveDAO (CRV), has presented a compelling proposal to halt the future expansion of decentralized exchange Curve Finance onto Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks. The proposal follows a similar call last month by Aave co-founder Marc Zeller to halt the deployment of the Aave protocol on the Bitcoin Layer 2 network BOB. “L2s consume the time of talented developers. Each of these chains requires as much care as Ethereum, but the returns are minimal. By cutting development in this area, Curve can focus on more productive aspects,” phil_00Llama said in a post on the CurveDAO forum yesterday. For years, Ethereum has adopted a “rollup-centric roadmap” strategy, aiming to increase scalability through Layer 2 solutions. However, this approach is now being questioned by some. Some advocate for a renewed focus on Ethereum's core layer (Layer 1). Related News: Nasdaq-listed Company Announces Major Bitcoin and Solana Purchase Curve Finance is active on approximately 25 chains, including Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and many more. However, according to DeFiLlama data, the platform's total locked value (TVL) is almost entirely on the Ethereum mainnet: approximately $2.3 billion. Layer 2 platforms Arbitrum and Base only hold around $50 million in TVL. phil_00Llama justifies this by saying, “Curve’s pools on the Ethereum mainnet generate 450 times more revenue than all L2s combined, even on the slowest day.” He also argues that the focus should be on expanding Curve’s stablecoin solution, scrvUSD, on Ethereum. A CurveDAO member noted that L2 deployments only generate around $1,500 per day in revenue, making it an inefficient strategy given the high maintenance costs and short-lived network structures. He argued that developers should focus on “more meaningful work” instead. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-02 06:10:10,49403539,1754115010,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation, and at the heart of the latest discussion is a bold Bitcoin price prediction from a familiar name: Arthur Hayes. As co-founder of the prominent BitMEX crypto exchange, Hayes’s insights carry significant weight within the digital asset community. His recent pronouncements via X suggest that Bitcoin could be on a trajectory to test the monumental $100,000 mark, with Ethereum potentially reaching $3,000. But what exactly underpins this audacious forecast, and what does it mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into the macroeconomic forces and strategic thinking that could propel these digital giants to new heights. What’s Driving Arthur Hayes’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Arthur Hayes’s outlook isn’t merely a speculative guess; it’s rooted in a nuanced analysis of global macroeconomic conditions, particularly focusing on the United States. His recent observations highlight that the full impact of U.S. tariff policies is expected to become significantly more apparent in the third quarter of the year. This assessment comes in the wake of critical U.S. nonfarm payroll data, which provides a snapshot of the nation’s economic health and labor market dynamics. Hayes underscores a critical point: “No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” This statement is central to his Bitcoin price prediction . In essence, he argues that the traditional economic engines of major economies are struggling to generate sufficient credit growth to stimulate nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). When traditional financial systems face such constraints, investors often seek alternative assets that are less correlated with conventional markets or that offer a hedge against potential inflation or economic stagnation. Key factors contributing to Hayes’s perspective include: U.S. Tariff Policies: These policies can disrupt global supply chains, influence trade balances, and impact inflation, potentially leading to a flight of capital into non-traditional assets. Nonfarm Payroll Data: While seemingly a labor market indicator, its implications extend to consumer spending, economic growth, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Weak or stagnant growth signals can prompt investors to look for store-of-value assets. Credit Creation Deficit: A lack of sufficient credit growth means less money flowing into productive economic activities, which can depress nominal GDP. This scenario often pushes capital into assets perceived as scarce or independent of traditional financial system vulnerabilities, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding the Macroeconomic Undercurrents Influencing Bitcoin Hayes’s analysis suggests a deeper interplay between global finance and the crypto market. The concept of “credit creation” is fundamental to how economies grow. When banks lend money, they create new credit, which fuels investment, consumption, and ultimately, nominal GDP. If this process slows down significantly across major economies, it implies a tightening of financial conditions or a lack of robust economic activity. In such an environment, assets that exist outside the traditional banking system, like cryptocurrencies, can become attractive. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is particularly appealing due to its decentralized nature, finite supply, and perceived resistance to inflationary pressures. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and burgeoning role in the Web3 space, also stands to benefit as capital seeks innovative and independent avenues. Consider the potential ripple effects: Economic Factor Impact on Traditional Markets Potential Effect on Crypto (BTC/ETH) Slow Credit Growth Reduced nominal GDP, potential stagnation Increased demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin Tariff Policy Impacts Supply chain disruption, inflation concerns Hedge against inflation, flight to digital gold Weak Nonfarm Payrolls Signals economic slowdown, lower consumer confidence Investors seek uncorrelated assets, pushing the Bitcoin price prediction higher Arthur Hayes’s Personal Market Moves: A Strategic Insight into Bitcoin’s Future? Interestingly, Hayes’s optimistic Bitcoin price prediction comes alongside some notable personal trading activity. Earlier, he offloaded significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethena (ENA). While this might seem counterintuitive to a bullish stance, it often reflects sophisticated portfolio management or tactical positioning rather than a loss of faith in the long-term potential of these assets. Details of his recent offloads: Asset Amount Offloaded Approximate USD Value Ethereum (ETH) 2,373 ETH $8.32 million Ethena (ENA) 7.76 million ENA $4.62 million Arthur Hayes’s strategic moves are often closely watched by the crypto community for insights into market trends and potential shifts in the Bitcoin price prediction. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future Such moves could indicate several strategies: Profit Taking: Cashing out gains from recent rallies to secure profits. Rebalancing: Adjusting portfolio allocation to increase exposure to other assets, or to raise cash for future opportunities. Tax Planning: Strategic sales can sometimes be related to managing tax liabilities. Funding Other Ventures: Capital might be needed for investments in new projects or personal endeavors. It is important to differentiate between a short-term tactical trade and a long-term fundamental belief. Hayes’s continued public optimism regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum’s future suggests his recent sales are likely part of a broader, more sophisticated financial strategy, rather than a sign of diminishing conviction in his long-term Bitcoin price prediction . Is a $100K Bitcoin Target a Realistic Outlook? The idea of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is not new, but it consistently garners attention. Arthur Hayes’s specific macroeconomic rationale adds another layer of credibility to this often-discussed target. While such a surge would represent significant gains for investors, it’s crucial to consider the various factors that could influence this trajectory. Potential Benefits of a $100K Bitcoin: Increased Mainstream Adoption: Higher prices often bring more institutional and retail interest, further legitimizing crypto. Network Effect: A rising price can attract more developers, users, and capital into the ecosystem, strengthening its foundation. Wealth Creation: Significant returns for early investors and those who have held through market cycles. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: The path to $100K is unlikely to be smooth, with potential for sharp corrections. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto gains prominence, so does the attention from regulators, which can introduce new challenges. Global Economic Shocks: Unforeseen global events could alter the macroeconomic landscape Hayes describes. Competition: While Bitcoin is dominant, the broader crypto market is dynamic, with new innovations emerging. Many analysts and models, including stock-to-flow models and various quantitative analyses, have projected Bitcoin reaching or exceeding $100,000 in cycles past or in the near future. Hayes’s unique perspective, tying it to specific macroeconomic indicators like credit creation and tariff impacts, offers a fresh lens through which to view this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction . It emphasizes that traditional financial pressures can paradoxically fuel growth in decentralized assets. Arthur Hayes’s compelling Bitcoin price prediction for $100,000, and Ethereum for $3,000, provides a fascinating look into how macroeconomic shifts could drive the next major crypto bull run. His insights into U.S. tariff policies and the global credit crunch offer a robust framework for understanding why he believes digital assets are poised for significant appreciation. While his personal trading activities might appear contradictory at first glance, they likely represent strategic maneuvers within a larger, bullish long-term vision. As the third quarter unfolds and economic data continues to emerge, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if Hayes’s bold forecast becomes a reality, cementing Bitcoin’s role as a formidable asset in an evolving global economy. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Prediction Q1: Who is Arthur Hayes? A1: Arthur Hayes is the co-founder of BitMEX, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. He is well-known for his insightful macroeconomic analyses and bold predictions within the crypto space. Q2: What is Arthur Hayes’s latest Bitcoin price prediction? A2: Arthur Hayes expects Bitcoin (BTC) to test the $100,000 level and Ethereum (ETH) to test the $3,000 level. This is his latest Bitcoin price prediction . Q3: What factors influence Arthur Hayes’s Bitcoin price prediction? A3: Hayes’s prediction is primarily influenced by the anticipated impact of U.S. tariff policies becoming more apparent in Q3, and his observation that “no major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” These macroeconomic conditions suggest a shift of capital towards decentralized assets. Q4: Why did Arthur Hayes offload ETH and ENA if he’s bullish on crypto? A4: Personal trading activities like offloading assets often reflect sophisticated portfolio management strategies, such as profit-taking, rebalancing, or funding other ventures, rather than a change in long-term conviction. It is common for traders to take profits even if they remain bullish on the overall market direction and their Bitcoin price prediction . Q5: How do U.S. tariff policies affect Bitcoin’s price? A5: U.S. tariff policies can disrupt global trade, potentially leading to inflation or economic uncertainty. In such scenarios, investors may seek safe-haven assets or inflation hedges, and Bitcoin is often seen as a digital alternative to traditional stores of value, which can drive its price up. Q6: What is “credit creation” and why is it important for the economy? A6: Credit creation refers to the process by which banks lend money, effectively creating new money in the economy. This credit fuels investment, consumption, and economic growth (nominal GDP). A slowdown in credit creation can indicate economic stagnation, making alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing.

2025-08-02 06:00:39,49403566,1754114439,"Top Crypto Gems to Buy Under $1: Why BDAG, ADA, TRX & XLM Are Breaking Out","Low prices in crypto often fool new users into thinking the project lacks potential. A coin sitting below the $1 mark might seem like small stakes, but in reality, it could hold much more promise than others trading at higher prices. The shift in the community’s mindset is clear now; today’s participants look beyond prices and focus more on practical developments and strong foundations. Names like BlockDAG, Cardano, TRON, and Stellar are proving that affordability doesn’t mean a lack of progress. These top crypto gems to buy under $1 are making real progress across different use cases. They’re not gaining attention just for their low prices but for the solid moves happening in the background. Let’s dive into why each one is gaining traction. 1. BlockDAG: Rising Presale Giant Already Raised $358M Excitement around BlockDAG (BDAG) is no longer based on speculation. The project is showing real action, backed by working apps, user engagement, and strong funding. At $0.0016 per coin, BlockDAG remains accessible but has shown momentum that can’t be ignored. The presale remains open until August 11th at this price. So far, BlockDAG has sold 24.6 billion coins and raised $358 million in total presale funding, reflecting strong user confidence. With a launch price of $0.05, early supporters have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660% since batch 1. That return is rare in today’s market and continues to attract attention. What’s more, BlockDAG has successfully hosted miner demo events globally, showing its X1 and X10 products in real use. It now boasts over 4,500 builders, daily competitions like Buyer Battles, and a 15% referral reward, all of which are helping increase participation. The growing activity suggests BlockDAG could climb toward $1, and with many speculating long-term targets between $5 and $10, the upside remains large. At its current price point, BDAG stands out as one of the top crypto gems to buy under $1. With limited time left in the presale and increasing demand, it’s attracting growing attention across the crypto space. 2. Cardano: Resilient Structure and Smart Contract Strength Cardano’s development strategy, built on academic research and proof-of-stake mechanisms, gives it a unique position. It’s energy-efficient and ideal for scaling decentralized applications. The focus has always been on sustainability, long-term development, and reliable upgrades. Since early July, Cardano’s price has surged over 50%, breaking through a 230-day resistance level. Analysts see an ascending triangle forming on its chart, often a bullish sign for future growth. With a previous all-time high of $3.10, even a partial return to that range could deliver 3x–4x growth. Among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, Cardano’s ongoing research-backed development and its use in real-world applications make it a solid long-term option for those watching fundamentals closely. 3. TRON: High Volume and Fast Payments Set It Apart Hovering around $0.33, TRON focuses on powering content platforms, games, and apps that need fast transactions. The platform processes over $2 trillion in stablecoin transactions each quarter, one of the highest volumes across any blockchain. It also handles more than 2,000 transactions every second, making it extremely efficient. TRON has just passed the $0.30 threshold, showing signs of bullish movement. Its solid activity levels, rising developer community, and wide adoption continue to support strong long-term possibilities. Market analysts suggest a jump toward $5–$7 could be realistic, with a full breakout to $15–$20 possible if global use spikes. Thanks to these strengths, TRON deserves its place among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, especially for those tracking usage metrics and developer traction. 4. Stellar: Evolving With Major Partnerships and Payment Tools Stellar sits close to $0.42 and focuses on simplifying payments across borders. By linking banks, businesses, and those without access to banking, Stellar builds payment solutions for developing economies. It has kept fees low and speeds fast, thanks to upgrades like Protocol 23. The project has partnered with top firms like IBM, PayPal, and MoneyGram, which increases its utility in financial services. These collaborations helped boost Stellar’s price by 30% in recent weeks, and there’s speculation of further gains ahead. With a push into the global payment space and improving features, Stellar holds strong potential to reach $5 to $10 over time, or even $20 with broader expansion. That momentum secures Stellar’s name among the top crypto gems to buy under $1. To Sum Up! Some of the most successful digital currencies began their journeys trading for pennies. BlockDAG has already seen 2,660% growth since its first presale batch and recently hosted successful miner product demos. With over 4,500 active builders, the excitement around BDAG is real and growing as it nears the final phase of its presale.

2025-08-02 06:00:29,49403223,1754114429,Crypto Experts Reveal Key Altcoins Poised for Breakout This August,"As the crypto market regains momentum, seasoned investors are eyeing August as a potential launchpad for select altcoins. While Bitcoin dominance remains strong, traders are beginning to rotate into high – upside opportunities across meme coins, gaming tokens, and emerging infrastructure plays. Altcoins with strong narratives, growing communities, and upcoming catalysts are quickly gaining traction. Among the standout names, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured analyst attention with bold upside projections. Market experts forecast that a $4,500 position in MAGACOIN FINANCE could become $52,500 , based on current momentum and rapid presale growth. With a deflationary token model and viral appeal, it is positioned as one of the most compelling entries of Q3. Four other tokens—Wall Street Pepe, Haedal, Bitget Token, and SkyArk Chronicles – are drawing increased interest across social platforms and analyst circles. Each brings something unique to the table, whether it’s cultural relevance, staking utility, CEX backing, or gaming utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Predict a 10x Upside Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE blends meme culture with a pro-freedom message that has gone viral across X and Telegram. Its presale has already passed multiple milestones, signaling strong early-stage demand. Analysts believe that the token’s appeal lies not only in its branding but also in its aggressive deflationary structure and reward – driven referral model. With market sentiment improving, MAGACOIN is viewed as one of the few meme coins with both high upside and lasting momentum. The forecast? A $4,500 allocation potentially reaching $52,500 if current buyer enthusiasm holds. Wall Street Pepe (WSPE): Meme Culture Meets Market Power Wall Street Pepe is culturally resonant meme tokens of the year. Mixing themes of financial rebellion, meme warfare, and old-school trading aesthetics, WSPE has drawn in thousands of holders and continues to trend on DEXTools. With ongoing community campaigns and token burns, it’s maintaining high engagement while preparing for potential Tier 1 exchange listings. For traders looking for a narrative-rich meme coin with staying power, WSPE is becoming possible option Haedal: Cross-Chain Staking With Real Yield Utility Haedal is a new staking-focused project that’s generating buzz for its ability to provide real yield across multiple blockchains. It offers a user-friendly dashboard for managing staking portfolios and earns rewards by integrating both on-chain validator infrastructure and off-chain partnerships. Analysts are watching Haedal closely as capital continues flowing into DeFi platforms with reliable APY potential and cross-chain accessibility. Its combination of usability and functionality makes it one of August’s most practical candidates. Bitget Token (BGB): CEX-Backed Momentum Builder Bitget Token, the native coin of the Bitget exchange, is experiencing renewed momentum as exchange volumes pick up. With Bitget expanding its ecosystem, launching new staking products, and incentivizing BGB holders, demand is surging both from traders and long-term holders. BGB has also held strong through recent volatility, making it a popular pick for those seeking a mid-cap token with real-world CEX utility and steady exchange support. SkyArk Chronicles (SAC): Gaming Meets NFT Economy SkyArk Chronicles is an emerging blockchain game that merges role-playing mechanics with NFT integration. Built by a team of Web2 and Web3 veterans, SAC offers immersive gameplay while enabling item ownership through its native token. As GameFi narratives begin to rebound, SkyArk’s ecosystem approach and active development pipeline give it an edge. With community quests and NFT drops scheduled for August, momentum is quickly building . Conclusion : August is shaping up as a crucial month for identifying breakout altcoins before the next market-wide move. From the meme-powered rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Wall Street Pepe to the staking innovation of Haedal, the exchange utility of Bitget Token, and the GameFi vision of SkyArk Chronicles, each token offers a distinct value proposition. MAGACOIN’s $4,500-to-$52,500 potential stands out, but all five are gaining analyst traction as capital shifts into higher-risk, higher-reward positions. With altcoin season heating up, early entry may prove decisive.

2025-08-02 06:00:25,49403071,1754114425,"Bitcoin Drops Below $115K as Traders Rush to Exit, But a Rebound Could Be Next","Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating a period of heightened uncertainty as its price struggles to regain upward momentum following recent declines. Over the past 24 hours, the world’s largest cryptocurrency recorded a dip to $114,326 before slightly recovering above the $115,000 mark. Despite this rebound, the asset remains under pressure, with recent market movements highlighting potential shifts in trader sentiment and long-term holder behavior. Data shared by market analysts indicates that derivatives activity is playing a significant role in current price fluctuations. Insights from the analytics platform CryptoQuant suggest that sudden changes in leveraged positions and aggressive selling pressure on major exchanges are contributing to the ongoing volatility. At the same time, on-chain data shows an increase in activity from long-term Bitcoin holders, suggesting a structural change in the market that may influence future price dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet Leveraged Positions Under Pressure on Major Exchanges According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin’s decline below $115,000 coincided with a notable reduction in open interest on Binance, dropping from $14 billion to under $13.5 billion in a short span. This 4% decline in open interest within a single day is often linked to liquidation events, where leveraged positions are closed automatically due to margin calls. Taha explained that many traders appear to have exited long positions as the price fell, potentially triggering a cascade of sell orders and amplifying market pressure. Net Taker Volume on Binance also turned sharply negative, nearing -$160 million, suggesting an increase in aggressive selling activity. This trend reflects fear-driven reactions among market participants, particularly retail traders, who may have chosen to close or reverse positions amid expectations of further price declines. Despite this wave of selling, Taha noted the possibility of a short-term rebound. A reduction in leveraged long positions combined with an increase in short exposure could create conditions for a market rebalancing or a short squeeze if selling pressure eases in the coming days. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Show Signs of Major Reallocation In addition to short-term derivatives market dynamics, other analysts are pointing to broader structural changes in Bitcoin’s investor base. CryptoQuant analyst OnChainSchool highlighted that in 2024, more than 255,000 BTC previously inactive for over seven years were reactivated. In 2025, this trend has continued, with over 215,000 BTC already moving within the first several months of the year. The average monthly movement of long-dormant coins has risen from 4,900 BTC in 2023 to over 30,000 BTC in 2025. Transaction sizes have also grown significantly, from around 162 BTC to over 1,000 BTC per transfer. According to OnChainSchool, these patterns indicate that large-scale holders, rather than retail investors, are reallocating capital on a scale not seen in previous cycles. The analyst suggested that beyond price fluctuations, these shifts may have long-term implications for market liquidity and Bitcoin’s future ownership distribution.

2025-08-02 05:55:10,49402910,1754114110,Ethereum ETF Outflows: Unpacking the Massive $152 Million Shift,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Outflows: Unpacking the Massive $152 Million Shift The world of cryptocurrency investments is always dynamic, and recent events have once again underscored this volatility. On August 1, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a substantial combined net outflow of $152.26 million. This figure, as highlighted by data shared by Trader T on X, marks the third-highest single-day net outflow since these groundbreaking products were introduced to the market. Such a significant movement naturally captures the attention of investors and market analysts, prompting a closer examination of what exactly transpired and what these Ethereum ETF outflows could signify for the broader digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Specifics: Which Ethereum ETFs Saw Outflows? To fully grasp the scale of these Ethereum ETF outflows , it is essential to look at the individual products that contributed to this considerable sum. While the overall figure is impactful, understanding the distribution across various funds provides a clearer picture of investor behavior and market preferences. The data reveals that several prominent Ethereum ETFs faced significant redemptions on this particular day. ETF Name Net Outflow (Millions USD) Grayscale’s mini ETH $47.68 Bitwise’s ETHW $40.30 Grayscale’s ETHE $37.20 Invesco’s QETH $8.42 Fidelity’s FETH $6.17 Franklin Templeton’s EZET $5.37 VanEck’s ETHV $5.18 ARK 21Shares’ CETH $1.94 This table illustrates that Grayscale’s mini ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW led the redemptions, accounting for a significant portion of the total Ethereum ETF outflows . The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating that the outflows were concentrated among specific products. Why Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows Happening? Decoding the Market Signals. Understanding the catalysts behind such significant Ethereum ETF outflows is crucial for investors and market participants. Several factors could contribute to these movements, often reflecting broader market sentiment or individual investor strategies: Profit-Taking: After periods of positive price performance for Ethereum, some investors might opt to realize their gains. This is a common practice in any investment market, where assets are sold after reaching a desired profit margin, leading to redemptions from ETF holdings. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall mood in the cryptocurrency market plays a significant role. Concerns about macroeconomic conditions, shifts in global financial policies, or even a general downturn in risk appetite can lead investors to reduce their exposure to more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutional investors and even savvy individual investors regularly rebalance their portfolios to maintain specific asset allocations. These Ethereum ETF outflows could be a result of a strategic decision to adjust exposure to digital assets in favor of other asset classes, or vice versa, depending on their investment objectives. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains in flux. Any perceived shift in regulatory stance or new commentary from authorities could trigger caution among investors, leading to a reduction in their holdings. Competition from Direct Holdings: Some investors might choose to hold Ethereum directly on exchanges or through other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, especially if they seek greater control, lower fees, or access to staking rewards not always available through ETFs. The Immediate Impact: How Do Ethereum ETF Outflows Affect the Market? When significant Ethereum ETF outflows occur, they can send ripples through the market. The most immediate effect is often a bearish signal, which can exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price in the short term. This is because fund managers, to meet redemption requests, may need to sell a portion of their underlying Ethereum holdings, thereby increasing selling pressure on the open market. Beyond price action, these outflows can also influence investor confidence. Sustained periods of redemptions might make new investors hesitant to enter the market through these ETF vehicles, perceiving a lack of momentum or underlying weakness. However, it is important to note that the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market is substantial. While $152.26 million is a considerable sum for a single day, the market’s ability to absorb such movements without a drastic price collapse speaks to its growing maturity and depth. Broader Context: Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows a Trend or an Anomaly? While the $152.26 million outflow is significant, ranking as the third-highest, it is essential to place these Ethereum ETF outflows within a broader historical context. Such movements are not entirely unprecedented in the world of exchange-traded funds, particularly in nascent asset classes like cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin ETFs have also experienced periods of substantial outflows, especially during broader market corrections or shifts in investor sentiment. These ebbs and flows are a natural part of capital movement in dynamic financial markets. The very nature of ETFs, designed for liquidity and ease of trading, means that capital can move in and out relatively quickly. Therefore, a single day’s outflow, while notable, does not necessarily dictate a long-term trend. Instead, it often reflects a snapshot of market sentiment and investor reactions to prevailing conditions. Understanding these patterns helps investors maintain perspective and avoid overreacting to short-term events, recognizing that market cycles involve both inflows and outflows. Navigating the Current Climate: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Ethereum ETF Outflows. For investors currently holding or considering investments in spot Ethereum ETFs, these recent Ethereum ETF outflows offer several key considerations and actionable insights: Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets, including those influenced by ETFs, are known for their volatility. Focusing on the long-term potential of the Ethereum ecosystem and its technological advancements, rather than short-term price fluctuations, can be a more effective strategy. Prioritize Diversification: As with any investment, diversification remains a cornerstone of prudent portfolio management. Spreading investments across different asset classes and within the crypto space can help mitigate risks associated with the performance of a single asset or ETF. Implement Robust Risk Management: Investors should only invest capital they can comfortably afford to lose. Defining clear entry and exit strategies, setting stop-loss orders, and regularly reviewing one’s risk tolerance are crucial steps in managing exposure to volatile assets. Stay Informed and Conduct Due Diligence: The cryptocurrency market evolves rapidly. Staying abreast of regulatory news, broader market sentiment, and fundamental developments within the Ethereum network is vital. Informed decisions are always the best decisions. The Road Ahead: What Do These Ethereum ETF Outflows Mean for the Future of Digital Asset Investments? The recent Ethereum ETF outflows underscore the dynamic and maturing nature of the digital asset investment landscape. While significant, these movements are part of a broader process where cryptocurrencies are increasingly integrated into traditional financial products. The approval and launch of spot Ethereum ETFs themselves represented a major milestone, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for a wider audience to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. This institutional embrace is a long-term positive, even if it comes with the typical market behaviors seen in traditional finance, including periods of profit-taking and rebalancing. Looking forward, the long-term success of spot Ethereum ETFs will hinge on their ability to attract sustained inflows over time, proving their utility as mainstream investment vehicles. As the market continues to mature and regulatory clarity improves, these products could play an even larger role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. The journey of mainstream crypto adoption is still unfolding, and moments like these outflows provide valuable data points for its trajectory. Concluding Thoughts: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum ETFs The $152.26 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 1 serves as a crucial data point, highlighting a period of significant investor activity. While substantial, it is essential to view these Ethereum ETF outflows within the broader context of market cycles and evolving investor strategies. These events are not uncommon in nascent markets and can often provide valuable insights into market sentiment and liquidity dynamics. For the burgeoning world of digital asset investments, understanding these flows is key to navigating the path forward and appreciating the complex interplay of factors shaping the future of digital asset investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot Ethereum ETF? A: A spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that directly holds Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making it accessible to a broader range of investors. Q2: Why did U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experience significant outflows on August 1? A: The significant Ethereum ETF outflows on August 1 can be attributed to several factors, including profit-taking by investors after periods of price appreciation, broader negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, strategic portfolio rebalancing by large investors, or reactions to ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset space. Q3: How do these Ethereum ETF outflows impact the price of Ethereum? A: Large Ethereum ETF outflows can exert short-term downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. This is because ETF managers may need to sell a portion of their underlying ETH holdings to meet redemption requests, increasing the supply of ETH on the open market and potentially leading to a price decline. However, the overall impact depends on the market’s liquidity and demand. Q4: Is this a common occurrence for ETFs in general? A: Yes, outflows and inflows are a normal part of ETF operations, especially in volatile or new asset classes. ETFs are designed for liquidity, allowing investors to easily buy and sell shares. Periods of significant outflows can occur due to various market conditions, investor sentiment shifts, or rebalancing strategies, similar to traditional stock or bond ETFs. Q5: What should investors consider in response to these outflows? A: Investors should maintain a long-term perspective, focusing on Ethereum’s fundamental technology and ecosystem growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification across different assets, implementing sound risk management strategies, and staying informed about market trends and regulatory developments are also crucial considerations.

Among this next wave of potential meme market leaders are MoonBull ($MOBU), Floki ($FLOKI), Brett ($BRETT), Popcat ($POPCAT), and Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT).

With major social buzz and development milestones already underway, MoonBull is positioning itself as the best upcoming crypto in 2025. The project has engineered scarcity and premium incentives to drive aggressive early demand. Once the presale opens, entry pricing will increase, and whitelist-only perks will disappear permanently.

Floki ($FLOKI) Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, Floki ($FLOKI) evolved from a simple meme into a sprawling crypto ecosystem. The project now includes a metaverse game (Valhalla), an NFT marketplace, and education platforms. Floki’s development team has aggressively expanded use cases while maintaining the viral humor that originally drove its popularity. Floki’s ability to evolve while holding onto its meme identity is a rare balance. The coin has gained listings on major centralized exchanges and is increasingly accepted by global brands. Such developments add legitimacy and long-term value to its meme coin origins. Floki earns its place on the best crypto in 2025 list due to its multi-dimensional approach, real-world partnerships, and a community that has proven resilient through volatile cycles. 3. Brett ($BRETT) Brett is a meme coin born from the iconic character in Matt Furie’s universe, closely tied to Pepe lore. However, unlike many short-lived meme tokens, Brett delivers high community engagement, organized transparency from the dev team, and consistent development updates. Brett rose rapidly in recent months, signaling early interest from retail and meme coin enthusiasts alike. It has become a cultural favorite across Telegram and X, gathering a massive following without relying on traditional marketing. This grassroots momentum is key to sustaining long-term meme value. Brett secured its spot among the best cryptos in 2025 because of its cultural roots, growing liquidity, and organic viral reach. 4. Popcat ($POPCAT) Popcat started as an internet meme and rapidly evolved into one of the most-talked-about coins on Solana. What makes Popcat stand out is its gamified tokenomics, where holding and engaging with the community earn extra benefits. Popcat’s humor-driven branding hides a surprisingly robust architecture. Built on a fast and low-cost Solana framework, Popcat enjoys high-speed transaction capabilities and excellent scalability. The project has already been embraced by meme collectors and NFT enthusiasts, giving it a wide web3 footprint.

2025-08-02 05:42:07,49423634,1754113327,Here’s Why XRP Doesn’t Need to be Backed by Gold,"Versan Aljarrah, XRP community pundit and host of the Black Swan Capitalist, has explained how he believes XRP could gain exposure to gold. According to Aljarrah, this could happen not through a gold backing but with XRP acting as a bridge for gold-backed tokens on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). His comments follow a wave of community speculation suggesting XRP might eventually be tied to gold, an idea that has faced criticism for lacking technical support.How XRP Could Create a Synthetic Link to GoldIn his latest commentary , Aljarrah clarified that XRP doesn't need to carry a gold backing to benefit from its value. He believes XRP just needs to facilitate the movement of gold-pegged stablecoins on the XRPL. In doing so, XRP would gain a synthetic connection to tokenized assets like gold, oil, and others that enter the blockchain through XRPL. The market pundit sees this role as a way for XRP to cement its future relevance in global finance.Notably, while the XRPL has not welcomed a slew of gold-backed assets, Meld Gold is currently leading the effort. The company is currently looking to introduce a gold-backed stablecoin on the XRPL.https://twitter.com/meldgold/status/1799063771161502000For context, each token represents one gram of physical gold, stored securely by custodians such as MKS Pamp and Imperial Vaults. Meld Gold will allow the token to integrate real-world assets like gold and silver with XRPL's DeFi tools, including its built-in decentralized exchange.So far, Meld Gold is the only project looking to launch on the XRPL. Other gold-backed tokens, like PAX Gold (PAXG), hold strong reputations but haven't launched on XRPL yet. Aljarrah sees a future where there is a flood of such tokens on the XRPL.Persistent Calls for XRP to Bridge Gold-backed Tokens Notably, the Black Swan Capitalist host has persistently promoted the idea of XRP powering a gold-linked financial system. In May, he released a critique of today's monetary structure. Aljarrah argued that tokenizing gold on-chain, particularly on XRPL, could lead to a more transparent and stable financial system. In that setup, XRP would serve as the asset connecting these tokenized gold units.Meanwhile, five months ago, Aljarrah claimed that financial giants such as JP Morgan, BlackRock, the BIS, and the IMF had already made private decisions to place XRP at the center of a future monetary framework. While he suggested that XRP could act as the eventual bridge of this system, he failed to provide any evidence.Theories of XRP Receiving a Gold Backing Lack Technical SupportThese comments come as other community voices have floated theories of a future where XRP sees a gold backing. In February, Edoardo Farina from Alpha Lions Academy speculated that XRP could connect to U.S. gold reserves in Fort Knox. However, he admitted that his idea had no proof and remained purely theoretical.Also, earlier this year, several XRP community members suggested that XRP would be supported by the gold price of around $2,953 at the time. This idea gained traction across social media, but like others before it, it lacked any technical support.Matt Hamilton, former Director of Developer Relations at Ripple, has consistently pushed back against these claims. Starting in 2023, and continuing through 2024 and 2025, he firmly stated that XRP couldn't be backed by gold.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,1,versan aljarrah xrp community pundit host black swan capitalist explained belief xrp could gain exposure gold according aljarrah could happen gold backing xrp acting bridge token xrp ledger xrpl comment follow wave community speculation suggesting xrp might eventually tied gold idea faced criticism lacking technical xrp could create synthetic link goldin latest commentary aljarrah clarified xrp need carry gold backing benefit value belief xrp need facilitate movement stablecoins xrpl xrp would gain synthetic connection tokenized asset like gold oil others enter blockchain xrpl market pundit see role way xrp cement future relevance global xrpl welcomed slew asset meld gold currently leading effort company currently looking introduce stablecoin context token represents one gram physical gold stored securely custodian mks pamp imperial vault meld gold allow token integrate asset like gold silver xrpl defi tool including decentralized far meld gold project looking launch xrpl token like pax gold paxg hold strong reputation launched xrpl yet aljarrah see future flood token call xrp bridge token notably black swan capitalist host persistently promoted idea xrp powering financial system may released critique today monetary structure aljarrah argued tokenizing gold particularly xrpl could lead transparent stable financial system setup xrp would serve asset connecting tokenized gold five month ago aljarrah claimed financial giant jp morgan blackrock bi imf already made private decision place xrp center future monetary framework suggested xrp could act eventual bridge system failed provide xrp receiving gold backing lack technical supportthese comment come community voice floated theory future xrp see gold backing february edoardo farina alpha lion academy speculated xrp could connect gold reserve fort knox however admitted idea proof remained purely earlier year several xrp community member suggested xrp would supported gold price around time idea gained traction across social medium like others lacked technical hamilton former director developer relation ripple consistently pushed back claim starting continuing firmly stated xrp could backed gold,0.031,0.787,0.182,0.9908,1
2025-08-02 05:40:10,49402165,1754113210,US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Staggering $812 Million Exodus Raises Concerning Questions,"BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Staggering $812 Million Exodus Raises Concerning Questions The world of cryptocurrency is rarely dull, and August 1 proved to be a particularly eventful day for investors watching the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market. On this single day, these highly anticipated investment vehicles witnessed a combined net outflow of a staggering $812.27 million. This figure marks the highest daily net outflow observed over the past five months, sending ripples through the digital asset community. Understanding these significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile yet promising landscape of digital finance. US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Reach Record Highs: A Detailed Look The sheer scale of the US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1 caught many by surprise. According to data shared by Trader T on X, the total net outflow of $812.27 million represents a substantial movement of capital out of these funds. This event underscores the dynamic nature of institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated investment products. The outflows were not evenly distributed, with some funds experiencing far greater reductions in their holdings. This highlights varying investor behaviors and fund-specific dynamics within the broader market. Spot Bitcoin ETF Net Outflow (August 1) Fidelity (FBTC) $331.42 million ARK Invest (ARKB) $327.93 million Grayscale (GBTC) $66.79 million Bitwise (BITB) $38.27 million Grayscale Mini BTC $33.60 million Franklin Templeton (EZBC) $6.57 million Invesco (BTCO) $5.08 million BlackRock (IBIT) $2.61 million The table above details the significant outflows experienced by various U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 1. US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Staggering $812 Million Exodus Raises Concerning Questions Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB accounted for the majority of the outflows, signaling substantial position adjustments. While Grayscale’s GBTC also saw outflows, its proportional impact was less given its larger asset base. Several other ETFs, including Invesco’s BTCO and BlackRock’s IBIT, also reported net outflows, though on a smaller scale. Some ETFs reported no change in their holdings. Why Did US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Occur So Suddenly? The sudden surge in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows prompts an important question: what factors contributed to this significant capital movement? Market analysts and observers point to several potential reasons, often a combination of macro-economic shifts and specific cryptocurrency market dynamics. Profit-Taking: After periods of price appreciation, some investors may choose to realize profits. ETFs provide an easy mechanism for institutional and large-scale investors to do so. Broader Market Correction: The cryptocurrency market is subject to cycles of correction. A general downturn in investor sentiment or a specific crypto trigger could lead to reduced exposure. Macroeconomic Factors: Changes in interest rates, inflation data, or geopolitical events can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Rebalancing Strategies: Large institutional investors often rebalance their portfolios periodically to maintain a desired risk profile or align with new mandates. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fluid. New proposals or increased scrutiny could cause temporary pullbacks. A single day’s data, while significant, doesn’t always indicate a long-term trend. These outflows could be a one-off event driven by specific circumstances affecting a few large players, rather than a widespread loss of confidence. The Immediate Impact of US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows on the Market When significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows occur, the immediate impact on the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s price, can be noticeable. While direct causation is complex, a large outflow from these funds can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin in the underlying market. Here’s how these outflows can influence the market: Increased Selling Pressure: When investors redeem shares, the ETF provider typically sells a corresponding amount of Bitcoin to meet those redemptions. This adds to the supply, potentially driving down price. Shift in Market Sentiment: Large outflows can be interpreted as weakening institutional interest, leading to a decline in overall market sentiment and potentially triggering further selling. Liquidity Concerns: Very large, sudden outflows could test liquidity in certain trading pairs or at specific price levels. The market’s reaction is often a blend of direct selling impact and psychological impact from perceived trends. Traders and analysts closely monitor these flows as an indicator of institutional conviction. Navigating Volatility: Insights for Investors Amidst US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows For investors, understanding the implications of events like significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is key to making informed decisions. Market volatility is inherent in cryptocurrency, and reacting impulsively to daily fluctuations can harm long-term goals. Consider these insights when navigating market uncertainty: Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s price history shows cycles of rallies and corrections. Investors with a long-term horizon often view dips as opportunities. Diversification is Key: A diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or traditional assets can help mitigate risk during downturns. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Rely on multiple, credible sources. Understand the difference between short-term market noise and fundamental shifts. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):: Investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price can help smooth out volatility. While large outflows can be concerning, they are a natural part of a maturing market where institutional participants actively manage positions. Such events test market resilience and often precede periods of re-accumulation. What Lies Ahead for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Despite the recent surge in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows , the long-term outlook for these investment vehicles remains positive. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. was a landmark event, signifying a new era of institutional acceptance and accessibility for Bitcoin. Looking forward, several factors will likely shape the trajectory of these ETFs: Continued Institutional Adoption: As more financial advisors and institutional platforms integrate these ETFs, their reach and asset under management (AUM) are expected to grow. Market Maturation: As the crypto market matures, volatility may decrease, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a broader range of investors. Regulatory Clarity: Further regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies globally could boost investor confidence and attract more capital into regulated products. While a single day of significant outflows is noteworthy, it does not erase the fundamental importance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in bridging traditional finance with the digital asset world. They represent a crucial step towards mainstream adoption, offering a regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. In conclusion, the $812.27 million in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1 was a significant event, marking the highest daily net outflow in five months. Led primarily by Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB, these withdrawals highlight the dynamic nature of institutional investment in Bitcoin. While such movements can create short-term market pressure and shift sentiment, they are often attributable to factors like profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. For investors, maintaining a long-term perspective, diversifying portfolios, and conducting thorough research remain essential strategies for navigating the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The long-term trajectory for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to point towards their increasing role in mainstream finance, despite occasional periods of significant capital movement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the large US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1? The significant outflows on August 1 were likely caused by a combination of factors, including profit-taking by large investors after periods of Bitcoin price appreciation, portfolio rebalancing by institutional funds, and broader macroeconomic shifts influencing risk appetite. Which US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced the largest outflows? On August 1, Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB led with the largest net outflows, accounting for a substantial portion of the total $812.27 million. Grayscale’s GBTC also saw significant withdrawals. How do US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows affect Bitcoin’s price? Large outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin in the underlying market, as ETF providers sell Bitcoin to meet redemptions. This can lead to a short-term decrease in Bitcoin’s price and a shift in market sentiment. Are these outflows a sign of declining interest in Bitcoin ETFs? Not necessarily. While significant, these outflows could be part of normal market cycles, such as profit-taking or portfolio adjustments by large institutional players. They do not automatically indicate a long-term decline in interest. What should investors do in response to these significant outflows? Investors should avoid impulsive reactions. Instead, focus on a long-term investment strategy, consider diversifying portfolios, and conduct thorough research. Dollar-cost averaging can also be a useful strategy to mitigate volatility.

2025-08-02 05:36:48,49402088,1754113008,The U.S. is delaying thousands of export license approvals,"The U.S. government is delaying the approval of thousands of export license applications, leaving several American companies unable to ship products and technology abroad, including to China. Two sources knowledgeable of the situation explained these delays , stating that the government faces internal challenges threatening to stop the approval process completely. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a key figure in Trump’s trade negotiations and tariff policies, is now facing criticism. His department is being accused of stalling critical trade operations. His team has failed to release anticipated trade regulations, maintained minimal communication with industry stakeholders, and suffered a wave of resignations and buyouts that reduced its pool of specialized staff, crippling its ability to function effectively. BIS delays approval processes for export license applications Earlier, Nvidia announced that officials in Washington had promised to approve its shipments of AI chips to China. Examples of these officials include Lutnick. However, reports reveal that their license has been delayed, diminishing the U.S. companies’ hope to initiate distribution soon. Considering the situation, one of the U.S. officials acknowledged that this was the highest number of license applications in history. Lutnick’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) team also raised security concerns surrounding these license applications. In a statement, an anonymous official said the Bureau of Industry and Security is imposing strict regulations and aggressive enforcement to align with President Donald Trump’s trade policies—disrupting the market. Individuals who wished to expand their business overseas and tech companies that aimed for stringent export rules expressed their disappointment in the agency. According to them, this demonstrates a lack of action, yet the agency’s role is to enhance international trade. Meghan Harris, who worked as an official on the National Security Council during the first Trump administration, has commented on the matter. Harris noted that concerning the operation of enterprises within the United States, licensing as an activity supports the economy and reinforces the position of the U.S. as a trading superpower. Hence, in light of her reasoning, these delays and uncertainties about the licensing approval process are a net negative concerning many aspects of their economy. Jeffrey Kessler’s action raises controversy among individuals The licensing process is one of the U.S. rules in the export sector, to monitor the movement of sensitive products and tech devices from getting into the wrong hands, threatening the country’s security. In March, individuals raised concerns about BIS’s under-secretary, Jeffrey Kessler’s practices of micromanaging the bureau and his lack of effective communication. These concerns were raised after Kessler asked BIS staff to minimize communication with company spokespeople and industry executives during a staff meeting. Later, he asked that all meetings be noted in a spreadsheet. This also includes staff requesting permission from Kessler’s office to join meetings with other government agencies, an approval that is reportedly difficult to obtain. Concerning Kessler’s strict regulations on BIS, a representative from the agency acknowledged that this was for the good of BIS to maintain its integrity. In addition, the representative stated that it is due to his strict regulations that he has managed to win Lutnick’s trust. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

2025-08-02 05:30:29,49401857,1754112629,Pi Coin Breakout Incoming? New Listings Could Spark Surge in 2025,"Pi Network has just integrated TransFi, a secure fiat on‑ramp solution available to over 70 countries , supporting 40+ currencies and 250+ payment methods, including credit cards and Apple Pay. This move eliminates the multi‑step conversion process, letting users in developing markets access Pi directly and seamlessly. With trading volume surging toward $80 million , and a fully diluted valuation around $41.2 billion , the upgrade sets Pi up for broader mainstream participation. As investor enthusiasm shifts toward tokens with real liquidity paths and arrival potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly catching attention for reaching an all‑time peak in market visibility and community buzz. Listings, utility, and speculation: What may drive Pi toward $2 Currently trading in the $0.40–$0.41 range, Pi Coin’s next major move hinges on momentum from exchange listings and ecosystem expansion. Some analysts suggest a move toward $0.75 to $2 later in 2025 if global deployments and volume growth continue. Technically, price action has shown a breakout above the key $0.42 falling wedge – a chart pattern often signaling bullish reversal. However, risks remain, including rising exchange supply and user-reported wallet issues. Analysts recommend watching circulation data and listing confirmations closely. V isibility all-time high as demand surges While Pi Coin captures headlines for fiat onboarding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is celebrating its own breakthrough in early – phase momentum. In July, the project consistently topped crypto trend dashboards and saw record-breaking community growth across the industry. Whale investors are quietly accumulating, driving visibility and demand beyond typical retail activity. With early-access still open but nearing capacity, MAGACOIN’s rare mix of limited supply, rising buzz, and expanding utility mirrors setups that historically preceded major moves. For those timing cycles, it’s now one of the most structured asymmetric plays on the table. Timing and narrative: Where early-stage plays stand apart Success in crypto often comes from pairing narrative momentum with timing and scarcity—long before tokens hit major exchanges. Pi Coin now offers fiat access and regulatory momentum, but it may still be constrained by supply dynamics. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is weaving that narrative into its early phase – with chart trends and whale activity signaling shifting capital. In past cycles, projects like this amplified sharply once buy-side interest converged with limited entry . Watching for access window closing, surging buzz, and development updates may be the best way to separate lasting opportunities from fleeting hype. Conclusion: Access, visibility, and narrative in sharp focus Pi Coin’s integration with TransFi could mark the start of a new growth chapter. But in the background, MAGACOIN FINANCE is hitting all-time highs in market visibility – and entering what many believe is its last early-access window. Whether Pi approaches $2 or not, timing is everything right now. When visibility , buzz , and scarcity overlap, opportunities often favor those who act early. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is precisely the kind of asset positioning itself for a potential breakout as broader recognition still lags.

2025-08-02 05:00:28,49400523,1754110828,Crypto Analysts Reveal the Top Picks to Watch Before August Rally,"With the broader crypto market showing signs of recovery, investors are bracing for what many believe could be a decisive August rally. Historically, Q3 has often served as a catalyst for altcoin breakouts following summer consolidation. While Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range and Ethereum navigates ETF speculation, several under-the-radar altcoins are rapidly gaining traction – driven by community hype, viral narratives, and emerging utility. Crypto analysts are now paying close attention to five specific projects poised to outperform in the coming weeks. These coins represent a mix of meme-driven momentum, infrastructure utility, and cross-sector growth potential. One standout is MAGACOIN FINANCE, recently flagged by multiple analysts for its staggering 14,200% upside potential . Others, like PENGU and Jeo Boden, are riding powerful waves of community interest, while more technically grounded tokens like RNDR and SUI continue to expand through developer adoption and real-world applications. Here’s a closer look at the five altcoins analysts are closely watching before the next market breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Flag 14,200% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly risen through the ranks of trending crypto projects. Fueled by political appeal and a deeply engaged base, it has already surpassed several key presale milestones. Analysts project a possible 14,200% return , citing parallels to early-stage SHIB and DOGE cycles. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE goes beyond meme hype – it leverages scarcity-driven tokenomics, social referrals, and strategic deflation mechanisms that give it a unique edge in the crowded meme coin space. With viral content spreading across social media platforms, MAGACOIN is becoming a dominant force in the current presale cycle. Jeo Boden: A Political Meme Coin With Relentless Momentum Jeo Boden is a parody-driven meme coin inspired by political themes and Gen-Z humor. What started as a fringe project has now exploded across social media, consistently trending on DEXTools and amassing a loyal holder base. Its cultural relevance and satirical tone have fueled a wave of speculative buying. While it’s intentionally unserious in tone, traders are taking it seriously—many viewing it as a high-upside play in the meme coin narrative of 2025. PENGU: Meme-NFT Hybrid Making Exchange History PENGU has quickly cemented its status as one of the most exchange-listed meme tokens in recent memory. With over 130 listings and growing, PENGU blends NFT utility with meme coin virality. Its expansion into plush toys, NFT drops, and influencer partnerships makes it stand out from traditional meme projects. Analysts believe its ability to bridge Web3 culture with mainstream merchandising could give it longevity far beyond the current cycle. Render (RNDR): AI Infrastructure Backed by Real Demand Render is increasingly seen as one of the few AI-related crypto tokens with real-world utility. By decentralizing GPU rendering across creative industries, RNDR is building the backbone for future metaverse and AI integrations. As demand for AI infrastructure intensifies, Render’s growth in both institutional adoption and developer use cases makes it a reliable mid-cap play with long-term potential. SUI: A High-Speed Layer 1 Gaining Ecosystem Support SUI continues to attract developers and funding thanks to its focus on high throughput, fast finality, and user-friendly design. Developed by Mysten Labs, SUI offers a scalable alternative to congested Layer 1s like Ethereum. Its rapidly growing ecosystem and strong community support suggest it may be one of the best-positioned L1s heading into the next phase of market expansion. Conclusion: As August approaches, these five tokens are gaining momentum across different corners of the crypto world. Whether it’s the meme-powered explosion of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Jeo Boden, the NFT utility of PENGU, or the infrastructure strength of RNDR and SUI, each project is attracting serious analyst attention. MAGACOIN’s 14,200% upside potential stands out as one of the most aggressive forecasts—but in crypto, early conviction often leads to life-changing returns. With sentiment shifting bullish, positioning ahead of time may prove to be a winning strategy.

These moves are viewed as part of a coordinated strategy to align with SEC expectations, especially after the Commission recently approved in-kind redemption structures for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Market watchers believe a decision on Solana ETFs could arrive as early as late August or September 2025. SOL Price Reacts Cautiously, But Long-Term Momentum Builds Surprisingly, Solana’s price dropped by over 3% following the ETF filings, closing at $170.24. This suggests the news may already be priced in, or that traders remain cautious amid broader market uncertainty. Technical indicators show bearish momentum, with SOL struggling to stay above key support zones at $170 and $158. A close above $180 could reignite bullish sentiment, while a drop below $158 may signal a deeper correction toward $145 or $130. SOL's price moving sideways following a major price spike on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview What Solana ETF Approval Could Mean for SOL While short-term volatility persists, the broader implications of Solana ETF approval are substantial. A greenlight from the SEC could legitimize Solana as a mainstream investment asset, increase market liquidity, and open the door for more institutional adoption. With over $60 billion in staked SOL and a maturing ecosystem, Solana is well-positioned to benefit once regulatory clarity arrives.

2025-08-02 04:59:29,49400462,1754110769,UK households are £11 billion worse off despite four rate cuts,"One year has passed since BoE began cutting interest rates, yet British households continue to feel the pressure from high borrowing costs. Bloomberg’s review of Bank of England data showed that despite four rate cuts since July last year and more likely to come, households are about $14.5 billion worse off each year than 12 months ago. This shortfall comes even though the Monetary Policy Committee cut its key rate from 5.25% over that period. Savers have felt the pinch as banks and cut rates on deposits, reducing returns on cash. Homeowners have not seen similar relief, since many are on mortgage deals agreed at the peak of borrowing costs and must wait for those terms to expire. These numbers underline the challenge for policymakers to reduce pressure for households and revive the weak growth in Britain, as they work to reduce the benchmark rate that was at 5.25% a year ago, highest since the global credit crunch. Earlier in April, Cryptopolitan reported that the Bank of England cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25%. Consumer spending makes up about 60% of the UK economy, and any recovery hinges on people spending more. But many remain cautious, saving money amid fears of further tax rises in the autumn. A GfK savings index rose in July to its strongest level since 2007. Bank of England to cut another 0.25 percentage point off the main rate The Bank of England is expected to shave another 0.25 percentage point off its main rate, taking it to 4% this Thursday with signs of the labor market is cooling following Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ April tax increases and rising global trade tensions. Yet inflation is at a 17-month high, running hotter than the Bank forecast in May. Governor Andrew Bailey is expected to urge caution on further easing. While energy bills and other temporary factors have driven prices up, officials fear that higher wage demands could push costs even higher. Lower rates have cost savers nearly £5 billion in lost earnings on cash deposits, including tax-free Individual Savings Accounts as well as time and sight accounts, based on the total stock of deposits and effective rates through the last year. Furthermore, households are paying about £6 billion more each year in interest on unsecured debts and mortgages than they were 12 months ago. In comparison, the US household debt also hit a record $18.2 trillion, based on an earlier report by Cryptopolitan . The Bank warns more borrowers will shift onto higher rates in the coming months, estimating that a typical homeowner could pay about £1,300 extra a year in mortgage costs over the coming 2 years. Approximately 1 million people have fixed deals above today’s rates and must wait before benefiting from cheaper credit. Since July 2024, just before the first cut, the average rate rose by about 0.2 percentage points on on the UK’s mortgage stock. Economists expect the Bank of England to stick to its easing cycle once every quarter, taking rates to approximately 3.5% by spring, 2026. Get seen where it counts.

2025-08-02 04:55:10,49400217,1754110510,"Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $114,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $114,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with monumental news: Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved an astonishing milestone, soaring past the $114,000 mark. This incredible achievement, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at $114,000 on the Binance USDT market. This unprecedented Bitcoin Price Surge marks a pivotal moment, capturing the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts globally. It signifies not just a numerical ascent but a profound shift in market sentiment and the digital asset’s growing influence in global finance. This article delves into the significance of this surge, the forces propelling it, potential challenges, and what it might mean for the future of the crypto landscape. What Does This $114,000 Milestone Mean for the Bitcoin Price Surge? Reaching $114,000 is far more than just another price point for Bitcoin; it is a powerful statement about its enduring strength and potential. This level represents a new frontier, challenging previous expectations and setting a new benchmark for digital asset valuation. Its implications are multi-faceted: Psychological Breakthrough: Surpassing such a significant figure often triggers a psychological cascade, encouraging more investors to enter the market, fearing they might miss out on further gains. It reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value. Increased Mainstream Validation: Each new all-time high attracts greater media attention and public discussion, further cementing Bitcoin’s legitimacy in mainstream finance. This validates the asset for institutional and retail investors alike. Enhanced Market Capitalization: A higher price directly translates to a larger market capitalization, making Bitcoin a more substantial asset class comparable to traditional financial instruments and even major corporations. Liquidity and Trading Volume: Price surges typically correlate with increased trading activity, boosting liquidity across exchanges and making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. This momentous rise suggests a robust underlying demand and a maturing market infrastructure capable of supporting such valuations. The Bitcoin Price Surge at this level indicates strong conviction among holders and a willingness to acquire the asset at higher prices. Key Drivers Behind the Unprecedented Bitcoin Price Surge Several powerful forces have converged to propel Bitcoin to this extraordinary valuation. Understanding these drivers is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of the current market rally: Driver Impact on Bitcoin Price Surge Institutional Adoption Major financial institutions, corporations, and hedge funds are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class. This influx of large capital significantly boosts demand and stability. Macroeconomic Factors Concerns over inflation, currency debasement, and global economic uncertainty push investors towards Bitcoin as a digital hedge or ‘digital gold,’ a safe haven asset. Supply Halving Events Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reduction (halving) decreases the rate at which new BTC enters circulation, creating scarcity. Reduced supply against consistent or rising demand naturally drives prices higher. Technological Advancements Ongoing improvements to Bitcoin’s network, such as the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, enhance its utility and scalability, making it more attractive for wider use. Retail Investor Interest Increased accessibility through user-friendly platforms and growing awareness contribute to a broad base of retail investors entering the market, adding significant buying pressure. These elements combine to create a powerful bullish momentum, demonstrating Bitcoin’s evolving role from a niche digital currency to a significant global financial asset, underpinning the current Bitcoin Price Surge . Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Risks for the Bitcoin Price Surge? While the recent surge is exciting, it is important to approach the market with a clear understanding of potential challenges and risks. Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant volatility, and a price point of $114,000 does not eliminate this inherent characteristic. Investors should be aware of: Market Corrections: Sharp rallies are often followed by corrections as profits are taken. A significant price drop after a peak is a normal market behavior. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could impact market sentiment and price. Security Concerns: While Bitcoin’s blockchain is secure, individual exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacks, leading to potential loss of funds. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin (whales) can significantly influence market prices through their buying and selling activities, creating unpredictable swings. Economic Headwinds: Broader economic downturns or shifts in global monetary policy could impact investor appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Prudent investors consider these factors and implement risk management strategies to protect their portfolios, even amidst a powerful Bitcoin Price Surge . Actionable Insights for Investors: Capitalizing on the Bitcoin Price Surge For those looking to engage with Bitcoin during this exciting period, a strategic approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing, thoroughly research Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and historical performance. Understand what you are investing in. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a single large investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility and can be effective during a Bitcoin Price Surge or downturns. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one asset. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies or traditional assets can help manage risk. Set Clear Investment Goals: Define your investment horizon (short-term vs. long-term) and your risk tolerance. This will guide your decisions during market fluctuations. Secure Your Holdings: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings to enhance security against cyber threats. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, market analysis, and regulatory updates. Knowledge is power in a rapidly evolving market. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results. Investment in cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks, and it is possible to lose capital. The Future Outlook: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Surge? With Bitcoin now firmly established above $114,000, the question on everyone’s mind is: what comes next? While no one can predict the future with certainty, several factors suggest continued growth and evolution for Bitcoin. The trend of institutional adoption is expected to accelerate. As more traditional financial products tied to Bitcoin emerge (e.g., ETFs), accessibility for a broader range of investors will increase. This could lead to even greater capital inflows and potentially sustain the Bitcoin Price Surge over the long term. Furthermore, as global economies continue to navigate complex challenges, Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, scarce asset may become even more appealing as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Technological developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as advancements in scaling solutions and enhanced privacy features, will also play a role in its future utility and adoption. As the network becomes more efficient and user-friendly, its appeal for everyday transactions could grow, further solidifying its position. However, the path forward will likely not be linear. Regulatory clarity, global economic conditions, and technological competition will all influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Despite potential short-term fluctuations, the fundamental drivers of scarcity, decentralization, and increasing utility position Bitcoin for a significant role in the future of finance. Bitcoin’s journey to $114,000 is a testament to its growing influence and the evolving landscape of digital finance. Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $114,000 The monumental rise of Bitcoin past $114,000 is a truly historic moment in the cryptocurrency landscape. It underscores the growing confidence in digital assets and Bitcoin’s unique position as a leader in this financial revolution. While the journey has been marked by volatility, the underlying strength, increasing adoption, and fundamental drivers suggest a future where Bitcoin continues to challenge traditional financial paradigms. This incredible Bitcoin Price Surge is not just a fleeting event but a significant indicator of a maturing asset class poised for continued relevance and impact in the global economy. As the market evolves, staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective remains paramount for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does the $114,000 price point signify for Bitcoin? The $114,000 price point signifies a new all-time high and a major psychological breakthrough for Bitcoin. It demonstrates strong market confidence, increased institutional and retail adoption, and reinforces its growing status as a significant global asset class. What are the primary factors driving the current Bitcoin Price Surge? Key drivers include increased institutional investment, macroeconomic concerns leading investors to seek hedges against inflation, Bitcoin’s supply halving events reducing new supply, ongoing technological improvements to the network, and growing retail investor interest and accessibility. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after such a significant price increase? Investing in Bitcoin always carries risks. While the price has surged, many analysts believe Bitcoin has long-term growth potential. It is crucial to conduct your own research, understand your risk tolerance, and consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) rather than making a single large investment. What are the main risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility at this level? Despite the high price, Bitcoin remains volatile. Risks include potential sharp market corrections, evolving regulatory landscapes, security vulnerabilities (like exchange hacks), and the influence of large holders (whales) on price movements. It is important to manage risk and only invest what you can afford to lose. How does institutional adoption influence Bitcoin’s value? Institutional adoption significantly influences Bitcoin’s value by bringing substantial capital, increased liquidity, and mainstream legitimacy to the market. When large financial entities and corporations invest, it signals confidence and can lead to sustained demand and price stability over time. What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin after this surge? The long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains largely positive, driven by its finite supply, decentralization, and increasing utility. Continued institutional interest, technological advancements, and its role as a potential hedge against traditional financial instability are expected to support its growth, though price movements will likely remain volatile.

However, a new development on the Cardano network could soon help turn the tide in ADA’s favor. This week, USDM , a native Cardano-based stablecoin developed by Moneta , officially launched. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, has called it “the most advanced stablecoin ever built,” suggesting it could be a game-changer for the Cardano ecosystem as it competes for real-world utility and institutional interest. Moneta's USDM is becoming the most advanced stablecoin ever built https://t.co/r32xbbfCbE — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 31, 2025 Moneta’s stablecoin is a privacy-focused asset that caters to enterprise-grade needs. According to data from DeFi Llama, stablecoin reserves in Cardano currently sit at $36 million – a negligible amount compared to the more than $11.4 billion reserves boasted by Solana and mere pocket change compared to $133 billion in stable assets parked in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Moneta (USDM) already dominates this market with a 32% dominance. The reason for this is that Cardano does not support traditional stable assets like USDT or USDC. Hence, the launch of USDM could foster a new era for Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, which supports a long-term bullish Cardano price prediction . Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Hits Key Trend Line Support Today Trading volumes today have increased by 9% as the price of ADA has hit a key trend line support. The crypto market was in need of a more pronounced correction like this after rallying for nearly a month. We can see that negative momentum has been accelerating as ADA got close to $1. The 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) seems poised to cross below the 21-day EMA and send a first ‘sell’ signal while the price has also hit the 200-day EMA. The confluence between ‘TL1’ and this key indicator increases the odds of a strong bounce. However, the price could break below this area and could still find support at ‘TL2’. This scenario would still keep the uptrend alive while the last line of defense before a ‘trend reversal’ verdict can be given would be the $0.61 level. The price action still favors a bullish Cardano price prediction at the moment as long as any of these support areas hold. The launch of USDM is exciting news for ADA. However, the best crypto presales like SUBBD (SUBBD) could outperform well-established tokens, especially as ‘altcoin season’ could start at any moment. SUBBD Raises Nearly $1M to Build the Ultimate Platform for Creators SUBBD (SUBBD) is reimagining how influencers earn online, giving them full control, better payouts, and a censorship-free space to grow. This new platform lets creators monetize not only their original work but also AI-generated content, opening the door to real passive income. With nearly $1 million already raised in its presale, SUBBD is quickly becoming one of the most exciting creator-focused projects in crypto. This project stands out by offering low platform fees and removing the unfair bans that often limit creators’ earnings on centralized platforms. Through the SUBBD governance token , influencers get a real voice in shaping moderation policies — something unheard of in traditional content platforms. Fans can also use the token to unlock subscription discounts , get early access to features , and enjoy other exclusive perks. With over 2,000 creators already onboarded and millions of followers behind them, demand for SUBBD could surge rapidly once the platform launches. To buy $SUBBD at its discounted presale price and reap the highest returns, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-08-01 18:47:52,49375821,1754074072,"Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Bill Takes Effect, Licensing Regime Now in Force","Key Takeaways: Hong Kong’s licensing regime could allow HKD- and CNY-pegged stablecoins to compete in Asian settlement markets dominated by the USD. Regulatory clarity may encourage institutional entry, but smaller firms could face high compliance costs under the new framework. Non‑USD stablecoin initiatives could test whether regional demand supports alternatives to dollar-backed assets in practical financial operations. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Bill officially took effect on August 1, establishing a licensing regime for fiat‑referenced stablecoin issuers. Under the new Ordinance, any entity issuing fiat‑referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong—or abroad if pegged to the Hong Kong dollar—must obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Hong Kong Among First Regions to Regulate Stablecoins According to a recent report , issuers are required to maintain proper reserve asset management, segregate client assets, operate stabilization mechanisms, and honor redemption requests at par value under reasonable conditions. The law also mandates compliance with anti‑money laundering and counter‑terrorist financing standards, risk management protocols, disclosure rules, audits, and fit‑and‑proper criteria. The Monetary Authority said it will conduct further consultations on detailed requirements in the future. Only designated licensed institutions may sell fiat‑referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong, and retail investors are limited to those issued by licensed providers. To combat fraud, advertising for unlicensed stablecoin issuance is prohibited, including during the six‑month non‑contravention period. Non-USD Options Emerge in Alternative Markets The Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council in May now places Hong Kong among the first global financial hubs with a dedicated licensing system for fiat‑referenced stablecoins. By enforcing strict reserve and redemption rules, the framework seeks to reduce systemic risks and protect retail participants. Green fintech is reshaping finance for a sustainable future. As climate action and ESG integration take centre stage globally, this powerful fusion of finance and technology is driving real change. pic.twitter.com/gadX2UN2ny — HKMA 香港金融管理局 (@hkmagovhk) July 30, 2025 Institutional adoption may increase under the regime, as regulatory clarity often attracts larger financial players. However, compliance costs could limit participation from smaller firms, potentially concentrating the market among major issuers. The law also positions Hong Kong to compete with jurisdictions like the U.S. and Singapore, where stablecoin frameworks are advancing. International alignment may prove key in drawing cross‑border capital and facilitating regulatory cooperation. With the U.S. dollar-based stablecoins taking the lead in the global market, products like the HKD stablecoins and offshore CNY stablecoins are exploring opportunities to break out of the USD dominance in regional markets. If successful, the launch of non-USD stablecoins could offer a widely accepted alternative to mainstream settlement measures. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Will the licensing regime impact stablecoin transaction fees in Hong Kong? By enforcing reserve and compliance requirements, issuers may face higher operational costs, which could influence transaction fees for users. What protections exist if a licensed stablecoin issuer fails? The reserve segregation and redemption rules are designed to ensure holders can redeem at par value even if the issuer collapses. Could banks in Hong Kong play a role in issuing licensed stablecoins? Yes.

With XRP’s popularity continuing to rise, driven by the craze for cross-border payments and ETFs, the launch of these contracts is timely, marking the deepening of the “cloud income” era for digital assets. Turning XRP into Daily Cash As a highly liquid cryptocurrency with low transfer costs, XRP has recently gained favor with both institutional and retail investors. Mint Miner’s newly launched XRP Cloud Mining Contracts allow users to purchase cloud computing power directly with XRP, without the need to convert it to BTC or fiat currency. This reduces transaction friction and significantly improves asset operation efficiency.

ChatGPT’s ETH analysis synthesizes 26 real-time technical indicators, ETF institutional flows, 10th anniversary developments, and ecosystem growth metrics to assess ETH’s 90-day trajectory amid key technical inflection between healthy consolidation and explosive breakout momentum. Technical Analysis: Healthy Pullback Within Strong Bullish Structure Ethereum’s current price of $3,616 reflects a -2.24% daily decline from $3,699 , establishing a trading range between $3,725 (high) and $3,568 (low). This controlled volatility demonstrates healthy correction within a strong uptrend structure. Source: TradingView Moving averages reveal an exceptional bullish structure with ETH above all major EMAs: 20-day at $3,539 ( +2.1% ), 50-day at $3,136 ( +13.3% ), 100-day at $2,828 ( +21.8% ), and 200-day at $2,693 ( +25.5% ). This represents one of ETH’s strongest technical setups recently. The RSI at 60.95 sits in neutral-bullish territory with substantial room for continued upward movement. MACD shows mixed signs at -35.25, but a positive histogram at 270.03 suggests building momentum despite bearish positioning. Source: TradingView Volume at 31.4K ETH indicates steady institutional participation, while ATR at 2,540 suggests a high volatility environment with potential for massive moves once consolidation resolves. Historical Context: Explosive Recovery from Spring Correction Ethereum’s 2025 performance demonstrates strong resilience with explosive recovery from April’s $1,385 low to current consolidation above $3,600 . This 168%+ appreciation showcases fundamental strength and institutional confidence. January-March correction from $3,298 to $1,823 , followed by April’s decline to $1,500 , established institutional accumulation opportunities. The decisive spring bottom marked the foundation for explosive recovery momentum. May-July recovery showed consistent strength with ETH rebounding from $1,700 to $3,650 in June, continuing toward current levels. Source: TradingView This 51.84% monthly gain represents Ethereum’s strongest performance since 2022 . Current pricing sits 25.75% below all-time high while maintaining extraordinary 862,000%+ gains from 2015 lows, showing both remaining upside potential and proven institutional-grade appreciation capacity. Support & Resistance: Multiple Strong EMA Support Layers Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $3,568 , reinforced by the key 20-day EMA at $3,539 . This confluence provides primary defense with multiple EMA layers, creating exceptional downside protection. Key support demonstrates strong depth with 50-day EMA at $3,136 ( +13.3% buffer), 100-day EMA at $2,828 ( +21.8% buffer), and 200-day EMA at $2,693 ( +25.5% buffer). Resistance begins at today’s high around $3,725 , followed by psychological resistance at $3,800-$3,900 . Source: TradingView Major resistance emerges at $4,000-$4,100, where previous cycle highs create overhead pressure requiring substantial volume. The setup suggests pullbacks would find multiple support levels, while a breakout above $3,725 could trigger rapid appreciation toward $3,800-$4,000 based on ETF momentum. ETF Breakthrough: BlackRock Leads Institutional Adoption BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF recorded exceptional $17.65 million daily inflows, contributing to total ETF net flows of $29.83 million across nine Ethereum ETFs.

This scenario requires sustained volume above 50K ETH daily and a successful break above $3,800 resistance. Source: TradingView Technical targets include $4,000 , $4,500 , and $5,500 based on historical resistance levels and institutional flow projections. Extended Consolidation (30% Probability) Broader market uncertainty could result in extended consolidation between $3,200-$3,800 , allowing technical indicators to reset while institutional positioning continues. Source: TradingView Support at multiple EMA levels would likely hold during consolidation, with volume normalizing around 35-40K ETH daily. This sideways action could extend 6-10 weeks pending major catalyst developments. Correction on Market Weakness (20% Probability) Broader crypto market weakness could trigger selling toward $3,100-$3,400 support levels, representing 10-15% downside from current levels. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on ETF buying at lower levels and continued institutional adoption through dip-buying opportunities. ChatGPT’s ETH Analysis: Institutional Validation Meets Technical Strength Ethereum’s positioning reflects unprecedented convergence of institutional validation through ETF adoption, technical strength above all EMAs, and ecosystem milestone momentum. Next Price Target: $5,000-$6,000 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires decisive recovery above $3,725 resistance to validate continued institutional momentum over healthy consolidation. From there, ETF adoption acceleration could propel Ethereum toward $5,000 psychological milestone, with sustained institutional flows driving toward $6,000+, representing new cycle preparation highs. However, failure to reclaim $3,725 would signal extended consolidation to $3,400-$3,600 range as the market experiences profit-taking.

According to the NYT report , this round of investors, which includes Blackstone, TPG, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Andreessen Horowitz, and other financial giants, has helped blow up OpenAI’s valuation to $300 billion. OpenAI has been planning to raise $40 billion by the end of 2025. When OpenAI announced its ambitions back in March, SoftBank immediately provided $30 billion towards the goal. Now, in addition to $2.5 billion from venture capitalists earlier this year, OpenAI has raised a reported $40.8 billion, way ahead of schedule. For its latest round, OpenAI’s biggest investor was Dragoneer Investment Group, a venture capitalist firm that coughed up $2.8 billion for the leading AI project. Furthermore, OpenAI’s revenues are up $3 billion over the last month, with paid subscribers reaching the 5 million mark. Co-founder Sam Altman’s other project, the ID-focused crypto Worldcoin ( WLD ), has also been growing this year, launching in the US in May. Despite the expansion of iris-scanning devices, WLD is dipping alongside the rest of the crypto markets, trading for $0.987 at time of writing, about even with its position three months ago, and down 52% since last year.

2025-08-01 18:40:10,49375603,1754073610,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Navigating the Sudden Plunge Below $114,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Navigating the Sudden Plunge Below $114,000 The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic shifts, recently witnessed a significant event: a notable Bitcoin price drop . For many investors and enthusiasts, seeing Bitcoin (BTC) fall below the $114,000 mark has prompted questions and concerns. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading around $113,900.01 on the Binance USDT market, according to recent market monitoring. This movement highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets and underscores the importance of understanding the forces at play in this evolving financial landscape. What does this latest downturn signify, and how should participants approach such market movements? Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop When the price of Bitcoin experiences a sudden decline, it often triggers a wave of analysis and speculation across the crypto community. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $114,000 is a case in point. This specific movement, observed on major exchanges like Binance, where BTC touched $113,900.01 against USDT, indicates a bearish sentiment taking hold in the short term. It is important to look beyond the immediate number and consider the broader context. Several immediate factors might contribute to such a sharp decline. These can include large sell orders from institutional investors or ‘whales,’ negative news headlines, or even cascading liquidations in the derivatives market. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, making them susceptible to rapid price changes at any hour. This constant activity means that a Bitcoin price drop can occur quickly, often without prior warning, necessitating constant vigilance from traders and investors. Here is a snapshot of the recent market movement: Metric Value Reported Price (Binance USDT) $113,900.01 Previous Support Level (Approx.) $114,000 24-Hour Price Change (Approx.) Significant Negative % What Factors Influence a Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the root causes behind a Bitcoin price drop is crucial for any market participant. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a complex interplay of macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and unique market dynamics. It’s rarely just one factor, but often a combination that triggers significant price movements. Macroeconomic Influences: Global economic conditions play a substantial role. When traditional markets experience uncertainty, such as rising inflation or interest rate hikes by central banks, investors might liquidate riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, to move into safer havens. Conversely, a strong economy can sometimes encourage more speculative investments, but a downturn often triggers a Bitcoin price drop as capital seeks less volatile options. Regulatory News and Uncertainty: Government regulations or the lack thereof, can significantly impact investor confidence. News of stricter regulations, bans in certain countries, or even just proposals for new rules can lead to a sudden sell-off, contributing to a Bitcoin price drop . Conversely, clear and favorable regulatory frameworks can instill confidence and attract more investment. Market Sentiment and News Cycles: The cryptocurrency market is heavily driven by sentiment. Positive news, such as major institutional adoption or technological breakthroughs, can fuel rallies. Negative news, like security breaches, scams, or even influential figures expressing bearish views, can trigger fear and panic selling, leading to a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Social media and mainstream news play a large part in shaping this sentiment. Technical Analysis and Liquidation Events: Traders often use technical analysis to predict future price movements based on historical data. When key support levels are broken, it can trigger automated sell orders, accelerating a decline. Furthermore, in leveraged trading, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can lead to massive liquidation events, where positions are automatically closed, further exacerbating the downward pressure. Navigating Volatility: Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Drop Experiencing a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, but it also presents opportunities for those who understand how to navigate market volatility. Rather than succumbing to panic, adopting a strategic approach can help manage risk and potentially capitalize on future recoveries. What are some effective strategies to consider when the market takes a downturn? 1. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. When the Bitcoin price drop occurs, your fixed investment buys more Bitcoin, lowering your average purchase price over time. This approach reduces the impact of volatility and removes the need to time the market perfectly. 2. Holding (HODLing): For long-term investors, simply holding onto assets through market downturns is a common strategy. Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant dips and reached new all-time highs. This approach requires patience and a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, allowing one to ride out a temporary Bitcoin price drop . 3. Risk Management and Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can limit potential losses during a sudden Bitcoin price drop . A stop-loss order automatically sells your asset if it falls to a predetermined price, preventing further decline in your portfolio value. Understanding your risk tolerance is key to setting these levels appropriately. 4. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a significant asset, diversifying your crypto portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or even traditional assets can mitigate the impact of a single asset’s decline. If Bitcoin experiences a sharp Bitcoin price drop , other assets in your portfolio might perform differently, balancing out overall losses. 5. Continuous Research and Education: Staying informed about market trends, technological developments, and regulatory news is paramount. A deeper understanding of the factors influencing a Bitcoin price drop allows for more informed decision-making, rather than reacting based on emotion. Historical Context of Bitcoin Price Drop Events Is the recent Bitcoin price drop an isolated event, or is it part of a larger pattern? History shows that Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by periods of extreme volatility, including numerous significant price corrections. Understanding this historical context can provide perspective and help investors avoid impulsive decisions. Since its inception, Bitcoin has experienced multiple cycles of massive rallies followed by substantial corrections, often referred to as ‘bear markets’ or ‘crypto winters.’ For example, after reaching nearly $20,000 in late 2017, Bitcoin plunged to around $3,000 in 2018. Similarly, after its peak in late 2021, it saw another significant Bitcoin price drop throughout 2022. These past events, while painful for short-term holders, have consistently been followed by periods of recovery and new all-time highs. This historical resilience suggests that a Bitcoin price drop , while concerning in the moment, is a characteristic feature of its market. It reflects the asset’s growth phase, where speculative interest and fundamental adoption often clash. Long-term proponents view these dips as healthy market corrections, flushing out excess leverage and allowing for more organic growth.

Bitcoin Price Drop: Navigating the Sudden Plunge Below $114,000 What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Drop? Predicting the exact future of any financial asset, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin, is challenging. However, market analysts and experts offer various perspectives on what might follow the current Bitcoin price drop . These insights are often based on technical indicators, on-chain data, and broader economic forecasts. Some analysts suggest that the current Bitcoin price drop could be a healthy correction, necessary to consolidate gains made during recent rallies. They might point to strong fundamental adoption, increasing institutional interest, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving events as factors that could drive long-term price appreciation. In this view, the current dip could be seen as a buying opportunity for those with a long-term horizon. Conversely, others might caution that further downside is possible if macroeconomic conditions worsen or if major support levels fail to hold. They may highlight ongoing regulatory uncertainties or potential shifts in global liquidity as risks. Monitoring key resistance and support levels on price charts becomes crucial for short-term traders looking to capitalize on or protect against further movements following a Bitcoin price drop . Ultimately, the trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on a confluence of factors, including global economic stability, regulatory clarity, technological advancements within the blockchain ecosystem, and sustained investor demand. Staying informed and adopting a well-thought-out investment strategy is more important than attempting to predict the exact bottom or peak. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $114,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be unsettling, they are a characteristic part of Bitcoin’s journey. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to these price changes, from macroeconomic trends to market sentiment, is essential. More importantly, adopting sound strategies like dollar-cost averaging, maintaining a long-term perspective, and continuous education can empower investors to navigate these volatile periods effectively. Bitcoin’s history shows a remarkable ability to recover and achieve new milestones, suggesting that resilience remains a core aspect of its market. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, informed decision-making remains the most valuable tool for any participant. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did the Bitcoin price drop below $114,000? The exact reason for a specific Bitcoin price drop can be complex, often resulting from a combination of factors. These can include large sell-offs by significant holders (whales), negative macroeconomic news (like interest rate hikes or inflation concerns), regulatory uncertainty, or a general shift in market sentiment towards risk aversion. Technical analysis also plays a role, as breaking key support levels can trigger further selling. 2. Is a Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? For long-term investors, a Bitcoin price drop is often seen as a potential buying opportunity, especially when employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging. This allows investors to acquire Bitcoin at a lower average price. However, it’s crucial to conduct your own research, understand the risks, and invest only what you can afford to lose, as prices can always go lower. 3. How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? The duration of a Bitcoin price drop varies significantly. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced both short, sharp corrections lasting days or weeks, and prolonged bear markets extending for months or even over a year. There is no fixed timeline, as market recovery depends on various internal and external factors. Patience is often required during these periods. 4. How can I protect my investments during a Bitcoin price drop? Several strategies can help protect your investments during a Bitcoin price drop . These include setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying your portfolio across different assets, practicing dollar-cost averaging to reduce the impact of volatility, and avoiding emotional decisions by sticking to a well-defined investment plan. Staying informed about market news is also crucial. 5. What is the difference between a correction and a bear market for Bitcoin? A correction typically refers to a short-term price decline of 10-20% (or more) from a recent peak, often seen as a healthy market adjustment. A bear market, on the other hand, is a more prolonged and significant decline, usually defined as a 20% or more drop from recent highs, sustained over a longer period, indicating a broader negative trend. Both involve a Bitcoin price drop , but differ in scale and duration. If you found this analysis helpful, please share it with your friends and on social media platforms!

2025-08-01 18:33:29,49375323,1754073209,Coinbase Tanks 11% Pre-Market After $1.5B Q2 Revenue Miss,"Coinbase shares fell sharply after the company reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations. Total revenue for the quarter came in at $1.5 billion, representing a 26% decline from the previous quarter. The shortfall was largely driven by weaker-than-expected transaction revenue, which fell 39% quarter-over-quarter to $764 million. Missing Expectations In the official release, Coinbase revealed that its subscription and services revenue also declined 6% to $656 million. Despite efforts to reduce variable costs, operating expenses climbed 15% to $1.5 billion. Coinbase attributed this largely to the $307 million hit related to the data breach disclosed in May. The crypto exchange recorded a net income of $1.4 billion, but this figure included $1.5 billion in pre-tax unrealized gains from strategic investments, including in Circle, as well as a $362 million pre-tax gain from its crypto investment portfolio. On an adjusted basis, net income stood at just $33 million, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $512 million. Coinbase’s trading activity also underperformed the broader crypto spot market, as global and US crypto spot volumes declined 31% and 32% respectively. Meanwhile, its total trading volume fell 40% to $237 billion, and the consumer segment witnessed a 45% drop to $43 billion. Consumer transaction revenue plunged 41% to $650 million, as volume shifted toward Simple trades amid low volatility. Institutional transaction revenue also saw a similar pattern, down 38% in both volume and revenue. While Base Chain activity grew, other transaction revenue dropped 21% as average revenue per transaction declined. As of the close on the previous trading day, Coinbase (COIN) shares were priced at $377.76, up slightly by $0.28. However, pre-market trading shows a sharp decline, with the stock down $42.30 (-11.20%) to $335.46. This steep drop suggests a strong negative reaction from investors, likely in response to recent earnings results. Despite grappling with declining revenues and rising costs, Coinbase is doubling down on product innovation. “Everything App” Earlier this month, Coinbase rebranded its Wallet as the Base app, launching a crypto-focused “everything app” that merges trading, social media, USDC payments, mini-apps, and tokenized posts. Announced at its “A New Day One” conference, the app runs on Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer 2 network and integrates Farcaster for social feeds, Zora for post tokenization, and encrypted XMTP chat. Users can earn from tips, interact with AI agents, and make one-tap payments. The platform also introduced Base Pay for Shopify merchants and plans 1% USDC cashback in the US. The app is in beta, while a full public release and developer tools are expected soon.

2025-08-01 18:30:43,49375615,1754073043,Strategy Outlines Bold Bitcoin Goals as it Leads Corporate Adoption,"Michael Saylor has once again shown strong support for the world-leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC). Speaking at a recent interview with CNBC , Saylor said that Strategy may one day hold as much as 1.5 million BTC. That would be nearly 7% of all Bitcoin in global circulation. This is a clear sign that the company plans to continue buying more. It also shows Saylor’s firm belief that the flagship crypto is the best choice for long-term store of value. Strategy Focus on Building a Large Bitcoin Reserve As of August 1, 2025, Strategy leads the corporate Bitcoin strategy, holding 628,791 BTC, 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. At current market prices, that stash is worth over $40 billion. However, Saylor believes the company could grow its holdings much more in the future. He explained that reaching 1.5 million Bitcoin is possible, although it may not happen all at once. The executive chairman described the top coin as “digital capital,” a new kind of money that powers Strategy’s business model. The company raises funds by offering preferred stock, then uses that money to buy more Bitcoin. This method lowers risk for shareholders and creates a way to earn returns. Recently, a planned stock offering of $500 million was increased to $2.5 billion due to high demand. It became the largest public stock offering so far this year, showing how strong investor interest has become. More Public Companies Are Buying Bitcoin During the interview, Saylor pointed out that more companies are starting to hold Bitcoin as part of their business strategy. Last year, about 60 public companies held digital coins; however, that number has increased to 160 today. Firms including Capital B, Smarter Web, and 21, a firm backed by Anthony Pompliano, Japanese-based Metaplanet have joined the movement. As he further explained, big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft are limited in how they can invest their profits. They cannot easily buy each other’s stock, and they face restrictions on buying into the broader S&P 500. As a result, some are now turning to Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. He believes the digital currency is replacing other assets like gold, foreign property, and public stocks. Strategy’s Financial Results Are Strong Strategy’s financial performance has also been strong. In the most recent quarter, the company reported earnings of $32.52 per share. This result was far above expectations, which had predicted a loss of $0.09. This shows that the company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy is working well. Other companies are also increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, reportedly added 2,509 Bitcoin in the second quarter. This makes Coinbase one of the top ten public companies holding Bitcoin, ahead of even Tesla.

2025-08-01 18:30:08,49375211,1754073008,How Long Will the Bitcoin and Altcoin Bull Run Last? Analyst Gives a Timeframe,"Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson said in his latest assessment that Bitcoin is nearing the end of the cycle for long-term investors, but argued that the bull market is not completely over yet. According to Wedson, there could be at least two more months of upward movement for Bitcoin and three more months for altcoins. Wedson noted that despite the growing influence of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been a strong wave of distributions from long-term investors. These sales amount to 50% of all Bitcoin held in ETFs. “Therefore, it would be a mistake to rely solely on ETFs, miners or individual groups,” Wedson said, adding that those who still influence the market the most are old investors and major exchanges. Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Donald Trump's Nuclear Threat Hits Cryptocurrencies - Here's the Latest Data Wedson, who included various on-chain indicators in his analysis, highlighted three key metrics: The last two years have seen significant increases in the movement of old BTC. This coincides with three major local peaks and serves as an effective indicator for identifying long-term investor sell-offs. Reserve Risk Indicator: This indicator, used to understand long-term investor behavior, has recently given a signal indicating increased selling and handover. SOPR Trend Signal: This metric, which analyzes all on-chain movements for profit or loss, issued a bearish signal a few weeks ago, warning of short positions ahead of the recent decline. In concluding his statement, Wedson argued that the Bitcoin cycle is still valid and the existence of ETFs does not disrupt this cycle. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, market watchers are shifting their focus to a new player quickly gaining momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Trading at $0.035, this emerging DeFi project has captured trader interest. Investors who join the presale now in phase 6 are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment when the project launches at $0.06. MUTM has raised more than $13.8 million and has gained over 14,700 investors. Dogecoin (DOGE) Stands at $0.24 Dogecoin is trading near the $0.24 mark, up over the past three weeks or so by about 44 percent since the coin started at an approximate $0.17 at the beginning of the month with volume trends holding just above the critical support area between the $0.22 to the $0.23 mark and seeing more consecutive bounce materials favoring a recent double-bottom implementation. Analysts observe the establishment of bullish patterns like golden cross and bullish open interest formation that would likely guide a break above the current levels into the $0.30s to $0.35s in the near future, in case the bullishness persists. Mutuum Finance Presale Growth Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of the presale, following a faster-than-expected sellout of stage 5. The subsequent stage will have the token price rise by 14.29% to $0.04. Early investors will enjoy an initial gain of 71.43% since the token goes onto the market at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has so far raised over $13.8 million, while the project has attracted over 14,700 investors, and estimates put the token at $2 following launch. Pioneering the Next Era of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is a platform in which the users retain control of the assets during the lending process. MUTM’s double-model which features Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer loan frameworks is applied to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Smart contracts facilitate Human-less lending in the Peer-to-Contract model. These smart contracts are market-driven through dynamic interest rates to maintain high interest rates. Peer-to-Peer architecture takes out middlemen and offers lenders and borrowers direct access. The architecture is utilized by users when dealing with meme coins like Shiba Inu, which are extremely volatile in nature. Enhancing DeFi Security Through $50K Bug Bounty and Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is conducting a $100,000 giveaway . There will be 10 winners that will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The project has also created a new leaderboard with the top 50 token holders that will be rewarded with bonus tokens for their positions. In order to further solidify its platform, Mutuum Finance has recently introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. Every bug will be rewarded, and the bounty will be distributed across four tiers, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dogecoin (DOGE) may be on track for a potential 2x rally, but with upside capped near $0.40, traders seeking exponential returns are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, MUTM offers early investors a guaranteed 71.43% ROI when the token launches at $0.06, and that’s just the beginning.

The data seems likely to put an end to the wait-and-see approach of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and set the central bank on a path to restarting rate cuts at its next meeting in September. That's sent the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond plunging 14 basis points to 4.22% and the price of gold pumping 1.5% to $3,400 per ounce and back within sight of its record high. Whither two other interest-rate sensitive assets: bitcoin and stocks? Not so much. With about 90 minutes to go in the U.S. trading session, both are at session lows, with the Nasdaq plunging 2.5% and bitcoin down more than 3% to $113,800. And bitcoin's an outperformer. Ether (ETH), solana (SOL) BNB (BNB), and dogecoin (DOGE) are all down about 6%. Notably holding its own is XRP (XPR), off just 2.9%. The president weighs in ""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell is a disaster,"" said President Trump on Truth Social shortly after the jobs report. ""DROP THE RATE."" Minutes ago, the president again took to his social media platform to call for the firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commission of Labor Statstics (the group overseeing the jobs data), accusing her of cooking the books to boost Biden/Harris last year and make things look worse under his administration.

2025-08-01 18:24:08,49377352,1754072648,"Analyst Says XRP Will Create More Millionaires at $1,000 Than Bitcoin at $1M","A notable XRP community pundit has suggested XRP will produce more millionaires at $1,000 than Bitcoin at $1 million. This statement came from Xena, who has continued to express bullish sentiments around XRP. She responded to recent disclosures, arguing that if Bitcoin can reach $1 million, XRP could also hit $1,000. According to her, XRP will likely produce more millionaires if both assets reach their respective milestones.Could XRP Produce More Millionaires?Her statement points to prevalent sentiments around how much further XRP can grow from its current price and how much more buying power everyday investors have with XRP compared to Bitcoin. Xena on X Xena on X Right now, XRP trades at $2.96. At this price, an investor can pick up 1,000 XRP tokens with just $2,960. Meanwhile, if XRP hits $1,000 someday, the 1,000 tokens, currently worth $2,960, would turn into $1 million. In comparison, investing the same $2,960 in Bitcoin at its current price of $115,095 would only buy 0.0257 BTC. If Bitcoin climbs to $1 million, that investment would grow to just $25,717. This difference is the major reason some investors believe XRP offers a better chance at life-changing returns . However, XRP would only present better returns at $1,000 because it has a longer journey to this milestone than Bitcoin does to $1 million.Xena's comments came as a response to a disclosure from another well-known XRP proponent, Anderson. He argued that if Bitcoin can realistically reach $1 million, then XRP should have a fair shot at $1,000. His statement pointed to what many in the XRP community see as a double standard. Most people believe Bitcoin can hit $1 million, but these individuals still doubt XRP could ever reach $1,000.Predictions of a Bitcoin Run to $1M+Specifically, many experts and high-profile investors have backed Bitcoin's long-term upside. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, believes Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. She has supported this view since 2022 and recently increased the target to $1.5 million, pointing to rising institutional adoption. Moreover, Fundstrat's Tom Lee also sees Bitcoin hitting $1 million within a few years. He calls it a digital safe haven like gold and expects milestones of $150,000 and $500,000 within five years.Meanwhile, Michael Saylor, who founded Strategy, has one of the boldest predictions. He believes Bitcoin could be worth $13 million by 2045. Notably, he bases this on the limited supply of BTC and the demand surges often seen after halving events, especially those expected in 2025 and 2026. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad , has said he expects Bitcoin to reach $1 million by 2035 due to rising U.S. debt and financial instability. Cardano's founder, Charles Hoskinson, thinks Bitcoin could cross the $1 million mark before 2030 thanks to growing institutional interest from firms like BlackRock. Some Believe XRP Could Hit $1,000For XRP, the outlook isn't as widely accepted, but some predictions still exist. In April 2025, CryptoGuard's COO said XRP could reach between $100 and $1,000 within the next decade. Changelly's analysts forecast XRP could climb to $1,020 by May 2040. Also, most recently, in July 2025, EasyA's founders discussed XRP potentially hitting $1,000, pointing to the expansion of the XRP DeFi ecosystem as a possible spark for such a rally.However, the more extensive journey required for XRP to hit $1,000 has contributed to the growing skepticism. For context, while Bitcoin only needs to jump 768% from its current price to hit $1 million, XRP must surge by 33,683% to get to $1,000. Also, if Bitcoin hits its goal with a 19.9 million token supply, its market cap would land at $19.9 trillion, still below gold's $22.4 trillion. On the other hand, XRP would reach a $59.3 trillion market cap at $1,000 with 59.3 billion tokens, more than double gold's value.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,1,notable xrp community pundit suggested xrp produce millionaire bitcoin million statement came xena continued express bullish sentiment around xrp responded recent disclosure arguing bitcoin reach million xrp could also hit according xrp likely produce millionaire asset reach respective xrp produce millionaire statement point prevalent sentiment around much xrp grow current price much buying power everyday investor xrp compared bitcoin xena x xena x right xrp trade price investor pick xrp token meanwhile xrp hit someday token currently worth would turn million comparison investing bitcoin current price would buy btc bitcoin climb million investment would grow difference major reason investor believe xrp offer better chance return however xrp would present better return longer journey milestone bitcoin comment came response disclosure another xrp proponent anderson argued bitcoin realistically reach million xrp fair shot statement pointed many xrp community see double standard people believe bitcoin hit million individual still doubt xrp could ever reach bitcoin run many expert investor backed bitcoin upside cathie wood ceo ark invest belief bitcoin could reach million supported view since recently increased target million pointing rising institutional adoption moreover fundstrat tom lee also see bitcoin hitting million within year call digital safe like gold expects milestone within five michael saylor founded strategy one boldest prediction belief bitcoin could worth million notably base limited supply btc demand surge often seen halving event especially expected robert kiyosaki author rich dad poor dad said expects bitcoin reach million due rising debt financial instability cardano founder charles hoskinson think bitcoin could cross million mark thanks growing institutional interest firm like blackrock believe xrp could hit xrp outlook widely accepted prediction still exist april cryptoguard coo said xrp could reach within next decade changelly analyst forecast xrp could climb may also recently july easya founder discussed xrp potentially hitting pointing expansion xrp defi ecosystem possible spark extensive journey required xrp hit contributed growing skepticism context bitcoin need jump current price hit million xrp must surge get also bitcoin hit goal million token supply market cap would land trillion still gold trillion hand xrp would reach trillion market cap billion token double gold value,0.048,0.769,0.184,0.9906,1

2025-08-01 18:10:11,49374430,1754071811,Carbon Credit Tokenization: DevvStream’s Bold $10 Million Crypto Investment Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld Carbon Credit Tokenization: DevvStream’s Bold $10 Million Crypto Investment Unveiled In a move that bridges traditional finance with the cutting edge of digital assets and sustainability, Nasdaq-listed DevvStream has made a significant commitment, deploying $10 million into Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). This strategic investment is aimed at accelerating their ambitious plans for carbon credit tokenization , a burgeoning sector at the intersection of environmental responsibility and blockchain innovation. This bold step not only signals a growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies but also highlights the transformative potential of blockchain technology in addressing global environmental challenges. What Exactly is Carbon Credit Tokenization? At its core, carbon credit tokenization involves converting traditional carbon credits, which represent a reduction or removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere, into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process transforms an otherwise illiquid and often opaque asset into a more accessible, transparent, and tradable digital commodity. Here’s how it typically works and why it matters: Digitization of Assets: Each token represents a verified carbon credit, allowing for fractional ownership and easier transferability. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger ensures every credit’s origin, verification, and retirement can be tracked, significantly reducing issues like double-counting. Increased Liquidity: Tokenization opens up carbon markets to a wider range of participants, from institutional investors to individual buyers, fostering greater liquidity. Reduced Costs: Automating processes through smart contracts can lower transaction fees and administrative burdens associated with traditional carbon markets. Despite these benefits, challenges remain, including the need for global regulatory harmonization and ensuring the underlying quality and integrity of the carbon projects themselves. However, firms like DevvStream are actively working to overcome these hurdles, paving the way for a more efficient and trustworthy carbon market. Why Did DevvStream Choose Bitcoin and Solana for Carbon Credit Tokenization? DevvStream’s decision to invest specifically in Bitcoin and Solana for its carbon credit tokenization initiative is a calculated one, reflecting a nuanced understanding of the crypto landscape and its potential applications. The firm, which specializes in financing and developing carbon reduction and removal projects, aims to leverage blockchain to enhance the integrity and accessibility of carbon markets. Let’s explore the rationale behind their choices: Cryptocurrency Strategic Rationale for DevvStream Bitcoin (BTC) Store of Value & Institutional Acceptance: Bitcoin is widely recognized as a digital gold, offering a robust and liquid asset for DevvStream’s treasury. Its growing institutional adoption provides a stable base for future crypto-backed ventures and adds credibility to their digital asset strategy. Solana (SOL) High Throughput & Scalability for Tokenization: Solana’s blockchain is known for its high transaction speeds and low costs, making it an ideal platform for issuing and managing large volumes of tokens. This is crucial for efficiently scaling carbon credit tokenization efforts, ensuring quick and affordable transactions for buyers and sellers. Its growing ecosystem also offers opportunities for integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The synergy between these two assets is clear: Bitcoin provides a strong financial foundation and market liquidity, while Solana offers the technical infrastructure needed for the efficient and scalable tokenization of carbon credits. This dual approach allows DevvStream to capitalize on both the established value of Bitcoin and the innovative capabilities of Solana. How Will DevvStream Fund Further Carbon Credit Tokenization and Infrastructure? DevvStream’s $10 million investment is just the beginning of a larger financial strategy designed to propel its carbon credit tokenization and broader infrastructure ambitions. The firm successfully raised $300 million through convertible notes, demonstrating significant investor confidence in its vision. This capital infusion provides a substantial war chest for initial crypto investments and operational scaling. Furthermore, DevvStream is actively seeking to expand its credit line. This expansion is critical for several reasons: Funding Future Crypto Investments: A larger credit line would enable DevvStream to make additional strategic investments in cryptocurrencies, potentially diversifying its digital asset portfolio or increasing its exposure to key assets like BTC and SOL as market conditions evolve. Investing in Infrastructure: Beyond crypto, DevvStream plans to invest in the physical and digital infrastructure necessary to support its carbon credit projects. This could include technology for carbon measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), as well as platforms for token issuance and trading. Scaling Operations: Expanding credit facilities provides the financial flexibility needed to scale operations, acquire new carbon projects, and enhance their capacity to generate high-quality, verifiable carbon credits for tokenization. This multi-pronged financial approach underscores DevvStream’s long-term commitment to leading the charge in sustainable finance through blockchain technology. Their ability to attract significant capital suggests a strong belief from investors in the future of tokenized environmental assets. What Are the Broader Implications for Sustainable Finance and Crypto Adoption? DevvStream’s pioneering move into carbon credit tokenization carries profound implications for both the sustainable finance sector and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. It represents a tangible example of how blockchain technology can be leveraged for real-world impact, moving beyond speculative trading to address pressing global issues like climate change. Key implications include: Increased Institutional Crypto Adoption: When a Nasdaq-listed company invests millions in BTC and SOL for a specific business purpose, it sends a powerful signal to other traditional institutions. This can accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets and operational tools, rather than just speculative investments. Democratization of Carbon Markets: Tokenization can lower the barrier to entry for smaller businesses and even individuals to participate in carbon markets. This allows more diverse entities to contribute to climate action and benefit from the value of carbon credits, fostering a more inclusive environmental economy. Enhanced ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Investing: For ESG-focused investors, tokenized carbon credits offer a new, transparent, and verifiable way to incorporate environmental impact into their portfolios. This can drive more capital towards sustainable projects and incentivize corporate responsibility. New Financial Products and Services: The emergence of tokenized carbon credits creates opportunities for innovative financial products, such as carbon-backed stablecoins, decentralized carbon exchanges, and climate-focused DeFi protocols. This expands the utility and depth of the crypto market. This convergence of sustainability and blockchain has the potential to unlock significant value, creating a more efficient, transparent, and impactful global carbon market. DevvStream is setting a precedent that other companies may soon follow. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Hurdles for Carbon Credit Tokenization While the promise of carbon credit tokenization is immense, it’s important to acknowledge both the opportunities it presents and the hurdles that need to be overcome for widespread adoption and success. Opportunities: Global Accessibility: Blockchain-based carbon markets can operate 24/7, enabling participants from anywhere in the world to buy and sell credits without geographical or time constraints. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows for credits to be divided into smaller units, making them more affordable and accessible to a broader range of buyers, including individuals and small businesses. Programmatic Carbon Offsetting: Smart contracts can enable automated carbon offsetting for businesses based on their operational data, making corporate sustainability efforts more efficient and verifiable. Innovation in Verification: Blockchain can integrate with IoT devices and satellite imagery for more real-time, tamper-proof verification of carbon reduction projects, enhancing the integrity of credits. Hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulations for tokenized assets and carbon markets can create legal and operational challenges for companies operating across jurisdictions. Quality Control of Credits: The effectiveness of tokenization hinges on the quality and integrity of the underlying carbon credits. Ensuring that credits represent genuine, additional, and permanent emissions reductions remains paramount. Market Volatility: While BTC and SOL offer benefits, their price volatility could impact the perceived stability of tokenized carbon credits, especially if they are directly linked to crypto asset values. Scalability and Energy Consumption: While Solana is energy-efficient, the broader perception of blockchain’s energy use can be a concern for an environmentally focused initiative. Ensuring the underlying blockchain can scale to meet global demand is also key. Addressing these hurdles will require collaborative efforts from technology providers, regulators, project developers, and market participants to build a robust and trusted ecosystem for tokenized carbon assets.

2025-08-01 18:09:52,49374426,1754071792,"Tron Volume Jumps 44%, Sui Drops 5%, Pi Suffers Unlock – Altcoin Season in Flux?","The crypto market enters August 2025 with mixed interpretations about whether an altcoin season is taking shape. While Bitcoin remains near its recent highs, some traders are shifting attention toward projects like Tron, Sui, and Pi Coin. Each shows contrasting price action and sentiment, making them part of the debate over the durability of the current altseason trend. Tron: Steady Growth With Utility Tron (TRX) has maintained steady traction in recent weeks. The Tron price is around $0.32, according to CoinMarketCap, with a market cap of about $31 billion and daily trading volume of nearly $1.54 billion, up by 44% within the past 24 hours. Here’s where I’ll be staying at @BlueOrigin ’s Astronaut Village! Comment on my Tiktok what you want to know about my experience—I’ll answer your questions tomorrow! https://t.co/gSJ9xlJpH6 pic.twitter.com/5oXcxmBk6x — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) August 1, 2025 July trading showed a stable range between $0.28 and $0.33. This consolidation suggests steady demand despite market volatility. Analysts cite Tron’s DeFi footprint and lower supply compared to competitors as reasons why it continues to attract flows during periods when altcoin season activity rises. Whale accumulation and consistent activity across Tron’s DeFi applications add to the case for continued relevance. Some research outlets have pointed to its ability to maintain liquidity and support ecosystem projects, which has allowed TRX to stay in the conversation despite stronger competition from the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. Sui: Growth Meets Recent Pullback The Sui price currently sits near $3.58, supported by a market cap of about $12.3 billion and daily trading volume exceeding $2.4 billion. Data shows a modest pullback of about 5% over the past 24 hours, after a month of strong inflows. Sui Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Sui’s object‑based design and parallel execution continue to set it apart among Layer‑1 protocols. On‑chain adoption in DeFi and GameFi has supported TVL growth, though recent price softness has tempered short‑term sentiment. LunarCrush metrics earlier in July showed strong social engagement, reinforcing that traders continue to monitor SUI closely despite the decline. Analysts suggest late‑2025 could prove important if upcoming integrations and ecosystem expansions deliver new user activity. For now, Sui represents an asset with utility and traction but is facing pressure from broader market sentiment. Pi Coin: Supply Concerns Pressure Sentiment The Pi Coin price is trading around $0.4 , with recent reports pointing to downward pressure following a July supply unlock. Pi’s daily volumes remain low compared to Tron and Sui, indicating weaker liquidity. Analysts note that a 17% drop in July coincided with a token unlock event of about 160 million PI, raising concerns about further dilution. Investor sentiment remains cautious. Without clear use cases or robust DeFi integration, Pi’s price action suggests it is more dependent on community participation and speculative cycles than underlying protocol adoption. Altcoin Season or Market Pause? The Altcoin Season Index remains 36, meaning that Bitcoin continues to outperform most altcoins. Yet the steady performance of Tron, the active though volatile market for Sui, and the ongoing debate over Pi Coin show that interest in mid‑cap assets persists. Some traders argue that altseason requires a broader rotation into tokens like these. Others believe current conditions represent selective trading rather than a full cycle. Whether this develops into a sustained altcoin season remains uncertain. Tron offers steady liquidity and usage, Sui continues to build out infrastructure despite recent declines, and Pi Coin reflects the risks of supply shocks.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 145,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may decline more than 7% from its current value as the flagship crypto asset declines along with the broader financial markets. The crypto analyst looks at the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Realized Price Distribution (URPD) model to determine the key support levels. The UTXO keeps track of the number of existing coins that last moved within a given price range. “Bitcoin has lost the critical $116,950 support. All eyes now on the next major level at $107,000.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $115,156 at time of writing, down 2.6% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) rival Cardano ( ADA ) may be printing a similar bull pattern from 2020-2021 and eventually increase to more than $5. “Cardano is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, only this time, it’s unfolding more gradually. And it feels like we’re right at the beginning of an explosive move.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ADA is trading for $0.73 at time of writing, down 3.8% in the last 24 hours. Looking at decentralized oracle network Chainlink, the analyst predicts that LINK will increase to around $44.50 before the year’s end as it remains trading within the bounds of a bullish ascending channel. “As long as Chainlink holds above the $13 support level, the bullish outlook remains intact. No reason to be bearish just yet.” Source: Ali Martinez/X LINK is trading for $16.68 at time of writing, down 5.1% on the day. Next up, the analyst warns that peer-to-peer file storage network Filecoin ( FIL ) may plummet in value after losing key support levels on the three-day chart. “Filecoin appears to be breaking out of a channel, potentially eyeing a move to $0.89.” Source: Ali Martinez/X FIL is trading for $2.36 at time of writing, down 4.6% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst warns that Pepe ( PEPE ) may have a massive correction if the memecoin fails to reclaim a key level as support. “PEPE needs to reclaim $0.0000118 as support to avoid a potential drop to $0.0000097!” Source: Ali Martinez/X PEPE is trading for $0.00001072 at time of writing, down 4.6% on the day.

2025-08-01 18:03:51,49375701,1754071431,Crypto ETFs See Record $12.8B Inflows in July as Market Rallies to New Highs,"Crypto exchange-traded funds on U.S. exchanges recorded their strongest month ever in July, attracting $12.8 billion in net inflows as investor enthusiasm surged alongside rising token prices and optimism around regulation. The data, reported by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas, marks a new monthly record for the sector. The only month that came close was November 2024, when markets rallied on the election of Donald Trump, who was widely viewed as favorable to crypto interests. This time, bullishness may be driven less by politics and more by fundamentals. The crypto market, as tracked by the CoinDesk 20 Index , jumped over 21% in July. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 7%, topping a new all-time high of $122,408 during the month. Much of the action centered around BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has quietly grown into a financial giant. With over $86 billion in assets, IBIT now outpaces established ETFs like the S&P 500-tracking IVV and the Russell 2000’s IWM. The fund’s higher fee structure makes it more lucrative for BlackRock than even its flagship equity products. These gains may be just the beginning. Earlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved in-kind creation and redemption for all spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a technical change that’s expected to improve efficiency and appeal for institutional investors. For large asset managers, in-kind redemptions let them swap crypto assets without triggering taxable events or facing liquidity crunches—making the funds easier and cheaper to manage at scale.",Markets|ETF Trends|BlackRock|Market|News,EN,1,crypto fund exchange recorded strongest month ever july attracting billion net inflow investor enthusiasm surged alongside rising token price optimism around regulation data reported bloomberg intelligence eric balchunas mark new monthly record sector month came close november market rallied election donald trump widely viewed favorable crypto interest time bullishness may driven less politics fundamental crypto market tracked coindesk index jumped july bitcoin btc rose topping new high month much action centered around blackrock ishares bitcoin trust ibit quietly grown financial giant billion asset ibit outpaces established etf like p ivv russell iwm fund higher fee structure make lucrative blackrock even flagship equity product gain may beginning earlier week security exchange commission approved creation redemption spot bitcoin ethereum etf technical change expected improve efficiency appeal institutional investor large asset manager redemption let swap crypto asset without triggering taxable event facing liquidity fund easier cheaper manage scale,0.0,0.692,0.308,0.994,1

2025-08-01 18:00:53,49374189,1754071253,XRP & LINK Users Shift to Spartans’ 300% Crypto Bonus,"No KYC, Just Rewards: Spartans’ 300% Bonus Pulls XRP and LINK Users From Traditional Casinos Tired of denied card transactions and slow fiat withdrawals, many in the XRP community are looking elsewhere. Recent XRP price analysis places the coin trading steadily above $3.20, supported by rising institutional interest and strong patterns targeting the $5–$6 range. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) has climbed past $19, with CCIP adoption fueling gains and resistance shaping around $19.30. The rise in on-chain use is matched by demand for crypto-first platforms. Spartans answer that call. It stands apart from KYC-heavy sites by offering direct access, fast crypto payments, and a frictionless sign-up process. As a result, XRP and LINK holders are increasingly choosing Spartans for a seamless, crypto-native betting experience. Spartans Offers the True Web3 Betting Experience Spartans delivers exactly what crypto users have been asking for: a fully digital betting platform with no personal info requirements. A simple email gets you started, and deposits can be made using BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, AVAX, or ADA. No ID uploads, no bank issues, and no waiting times. The platform works as blockchain tech intends, fully decentralized and permissionless. Spartans features over 5,963 games from more than 43 providers, covering high-volatility slots, live blackjack, crash games, and sports betting for football, UFC, cricket, and more. The site runs smoothly across mobile devices without an app and stays fast even on weaker networks. Whether placing sports bets or spinning slots, gameplay feels sleek and responsive. Bonus terms are straightforward and attractive. New players enjoy a 300% welcome bonus usable on both casino games and sports bets, with 25% reloads available every day. Promotions include simple wagering rules and a seven-day window, no tricks hidden in fine print. There’s also a Lamborghini prize and a detailed affiliate program with revenue share, CPA, and hybrid models. What sets Spartans apart is its design around crypto users. It provides full access and control without unnecessary delays or verifications. As more XRP holders exit fiat platforms, Spartans has become the preferred choice. Among crypto betting platforms, it’s already doing what others still aim to achieve. XRP Price Analysis Shows Strength Above $3.20 XRP is maintaining support above $3.20, with increased whale buying and volume spikes suggesting new momentum. It recovered from $2.96 and is now just below the $3.65 resistance level. Technical indicators show solid support between $3.00 and $3.08, and analysts highlight a breakout toward $5–$6 if strength continues. A broken flag pattern is one bullish signal in focus. Projections stretch as far as $10 or even $26.50 in some models, especially if XRP gains broad utility. Whale inflows have topped $500 million in three days, and the NVT ratio is at a four-month low, indicating true value transfers. The analysis also points to ETF rumors and growing institutional involvement. As the XRP crowd leans further into crypto-native platforms, Spartans continues to draw attention as a go-to utility option. LINK Price Chart Suggests Bullish Push Toward $20 The Chainlink (LINK) chart shows a steady rise from $17.90 on July 24 to about $19.04 currently. Resistance is noted near $19.30, while support remains above $18.00. Technical signals hint at a breakout, and volume growth supports the case. Analysts now eye a $20.50 short-term target, with some 2025 projections placing LINK in the $25–$30 zone. LINK’s CCIP continues to gain adoption across DeFi and business sectors, which boosts confidence. Demand for Oracle services also remains high, helping LINK maintain its upward trend. According to forecasts from InvestingHaven and CoinCodex, a strong Q4 in DeFi could drive even more LINK gains. With this momentum, platforms like Spartans offer LINK users a way to activate their holdings rather than just store them. Final Say! XRP remains strong above $3.20 with forecasts heading toward $5 and beyond, while LINK moves past $19 as CCIP sees more traction. But beyond price charts, users are seeking places where their crypto is usable. Spartans delivers that utility. With crypto deposits via BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, AVAX, or ADA and no extra requirements, the platform gives full freedom. No rejected cards or hold-ups, everything is fast and user-controlled. This is why XRP and LINK communities are turning away from fiat-based platforms. Spartans isn’t adjusting to crypto; it’s already built for it. For those looking at top crypto betting platforms, Spartans stands out with a clean interface, quick withdrawals, and solid rewards.

2025-08-01 18:00:48,49374905,1754071248,The Best Cross-Sport Crypto Betting Sites in 2025,"For sports fans who don’t want to stay locked into just one league or betting format, cross-sport crypto betting platforms offer unmatched flexibility. Whether it’s football in the morning, basketball at noon, and UFC in the evening, today’s best crypto sportsbooks are designed to handle fast-paced action across multiple markets. Instant payments, wallet integration, and in-play betting are no longer nice-to-haves, they’re essential for serious crypto bettors. This article breaks down the best cross-sport crypto betting sites in 2025. Topping the list is Spartans, a platform built specifically for users who demand instant withdrawals, seamless switching, and reliable performance across all major sports. 1. Spartans: The Best All-in-One Crypto Sportsbook Spartans has quickly taken the top spot in cross-sport crypto betting thanks to one key advantage: fluidity. Sports bettors no longer need to juggle multiple wallets or tabs when switching between games. Spartans uses a one-wallet system that supports top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and AVAX, allowing instant deposits and withdrawals across every part of the platform. From Premier League football to NBA basketball and live UFC fights, users can move between sports and markets with zero delays. What sets Spartans apart for cross-sport bettors is its speed. Winnings can be withdrawn instantly, without waiting hours or even days like on traditional platforms. Pre-match odds update in real time, and in-play betting is built to keep up with fast-moving events. Bettors can stack parlays across different sports in seconds and see payout projections instantly within the betslip. Spartans even displays live stats and match trackers inside the sportsbook, making it easier to place smarter bets on multiple events without needing third-party apps. Whether you’re chasing first-half goals, round-by-round MMA predictions, or point spreads in college basketball, Spartans delivers a clean, responsive interface optimized for crypto. It’s the go-to platform for anyone who wants high-speed cross-sport betting without limitations or banking delays. 2. Stake.com: Strong Selection, Slower Payouts Stake.com remains a household name for crypto bettors, offering wide market coverage across football, tennis, and even eSports. Its branding and community are top-tier, and the interface is polished for daily use. However, where Stake.com starts to lag behind is on withdrawals. While it supports crypto deposits, larger cashouts often require manual approval and can take hours. For users who bet across multiple sports and expect instant payouts, this friction can be a dealbreaker. Stake is still solid, but it’s no longer the fastest option in 2025 for active crypto bettors looking for seamless transitions between sports. 3. Bet365: Massive Coverage with Traditional Delays Bet365 is unmatched when it comes to sheer market variety, offering betting options on everything from major football leagues to niche sports like darts and snooker. It has a trusted reputation and a user-friendly platform, but its crypto integration remains limited. While it accepts Bitcoin in some regions, crypto withdrawals often face delays or require third-party processing. This slows things down for users who want to move funds quickly between matches or sports. Bet365 remains a heavyweight, but it doesn’t meet the speed demands of modern crypto-first bettors. 4. Betano: Flexible Sports Betting, Slower Wallet Support Betano stands out with regional sports coverage and flexible betting options, especially for European bettors. It offers good cross-sport variety and solid in-play odds. However, its crypto support isn’t consistent across regions, and withdrawals tend to rely on fiat pathways. This limits its appeal for crypto-native users who prioritize fast, multi-sport betting without banking delays. 5. BC.Game: Crypto-Ready but Interface Lags Behind BC.Game is a true crypto-first betting site with a wide selection of tokens and constant promotions. It offers betting across sports and casino, but its user interface can feel cluttered, especially when switching between live matches. While crypto handling is strong, speed alone isn’t enough. Serious cross-sport bettors may find the navigation and tracking tools lacking compared to top-tier alternatives like Spartans. 6. BetMGM: Mainstream Power, Limited Crypto Speed BetMGM brings the backing of a global brand and deep sportsbook features, including live betting and strong coverage of American sports. However, its crypto functionality is still catching up. Many users need to convert to fiat before withdrawing, which slows down the experience. It’s a reliable option for mainstream bettors but less ideal for crypto users seeking instant cross-sport action. Last Say When it comes to cross-sport crypto betting in 2025 , speed and wallet flexibility make all the difference. Platforms like Spartans have redefined expectations by offering a unified experience that covers multiple sports with instant payouts and easy wallet integration. While other names like Stake.com and Bet365 offer great coverage, they fall short on crypto fluidity. Betano, BC.Game, and BetMGM bring variety but still involve compromises in wallet speed or usability. For multi-sport bettors who want fast-moving action, seamless switching, and crypto-native reliability, Spartans leads the pack as the best all-in-one solution on the market today.

2025-08-01 18:00:45,49374112,1754071245,Huge Moment for XRP: Price At Key Support. Here’s What Is Next,"XRP is at a pivotal turning point. After a powerful breakout and sharp rally, the cryptocurrency is now testing a major support level that could determine its next significant move. According to popular crypto analyst Cryptoes, this is a “make or break” moment for XRP, and the market is watching closely. Breakout From Long-Term Falling Wedge Cryptoes’ chart, posted on X, highlights a successful breakout from a falling wedge pattern that had defined XRP’s price action for months. The wedge, with a declining resistance line and a flat support base near $2.00, had formed between March and July 2025. Historically, falling wedges are considered bullish reversal patterns, and XRP respected that textbook behavior. In mid-July, XRP broke out of the wedge with strength, skyrocketing from around $2.10 to over $3.50 in a matter of days. This move not only confirmed the wedge breakout but also restored bullish momentum to the asset after a prolonged period of sideways consolidation. HUGE Moment for #XRP | Price at HUGE support level | Make or break! pic.twitter.com/tkqx6iO3oR — Cryptoes (@cryptoes_ta) August 1, 2025 Retesting Former Resistance As New Support Following the rally, XRP has now retraced slightly and is trading at approximately $2.94 as of report time. The price has pulled back to a key horizontal zone, the same $2.90–$3.00 level that had acted as strong resistance earlier this year, particularly in February and March. This zone is now being retested as support, a classic technical move that often precedes a continuation of the trend. As highlighted in Cryptoes’ chart, the blue horizontal band represents this critical area. If buyers step in and hold the line, XRP could establish a new base for another upward leg. However, failure to hold this level could expose XRP to a deeper retracement, with potential downside targets around $2.50 or even back toward the wedge breakout zone near $2.10. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Indicators Reflect Cooling Momentum, Not Reversal The chart also includes dotted parabolic SAR markers and a white curved trend line, both indicating that while bullish momentum has cooled, the uptrend remains technically valid . The parabolic SAR dots, now appearing above recent candles, suggest consolidation or a short-term pause, not yet a confirmed reversal. Corrections like this are common and even healthy following large, impulsive moves. A successful retest of this support could fuel renewed buying interest and set XRP on course to reclaim $3.50 and potentially push toward $4.00 and higher. XRP’s current price action is resting on a knife’s edge. After breaking out of a major wedge and rallying to multi-month highs, the asset now faces a critical test at the $2.90–$3.00 zone. According to Cryptoes, this is a crucial support level that must hold if the uptrend is to continue. The coming days will be decisive: either bulls defend this zone and spark the next leg higher, or a breakdown signals a broader correction. For XRP, this is indeed a huge moment, and what happens next will shape the trajectory for the rest of Q3. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-08-01 18:00:24,49374117,1754071224,Ripple Exec Reveals What Will Drive The XRP Price Value,"Ripple Labs Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has offered rare and pointed clarity on what drives the XRP price value in the long term, despite the company’s recent spotlight on its new stablecoin, RLUSD. In a recent exchange with an XRP supporter on social media, Schwartz emphasized that the crypto continues to sit at the core of Ripple’s payment infrastructure, especially as the main bridge asset in cross-border transfers. XRP’s Role As A Bridge Asset Is Still Central While RLUSD plays a specific role, Schwartz reveals XRP’s utility in real financial use cases will ultimately boost its value. His comments reaffirm Ripple’s longstanding plan for the digital asset, relying on XRP for its proven liquidity and built-in role on the ledger as it explores other digital options. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Analyst Sees $5 Surge Any Moment – Details In his response, Schwartz directly addressed growing speculation that the company may be shifting its attention away from XRP in favor of its new stablecoin, assuring that the digital asset remains Ripple’s cross-currency asset that allows for fast, low-cost currency exchanges. While Schwartz didn’t share exact data, he said he was confident that the token’s usage “dwarfs every other asset” in Ripple’s system. XRP links to how the XRP Ledger functions, so an increase in ledger activity is almost guaranteed to drive more demand for the crypto token, naturally lifting its price value as it becomes more essential in global financial workflows. Schwartz argued that as real-world adoption of the Ripple blockchain networks grows, so will demand for XRP. The embedded demand, as more businesses and developers build on XRPL, is what could be the core driver of XRP’s future price value. Ripple CTO: Stablecoins Support, XRP Sustains Some community members worried that Ripple’s new stablecoin RLUSD, launched in December 2024, could replace the crypto token, but Schwartz clarifies that the stablecoin and XRP serve different purposes. He said stablecoins like RLUSD are better suited for use cases that require a fixed value, such as when companies post collateral or need to enter and exit markets without dealing with large price swings. Related Reading: XRP Blows Cold: Price Crash To $2.15 Still Possible If Buyers Falter Volatility in crypto markets can be disruptive in these scenarios, and stablecoins avoid that issue by holding a steady price. However, Schwartz believes that for most other applications, especially those related to real finance and long-term holdings, digital assets like XRP are still the better choice. He noted that, unless highly risk-averse, most long-term users would likely prefer holding the top digital asset over cash because of their potential for upside and active role in blockchain ecosystems. The Ripple exec added that as more institutions turn to XRPL for financial use cases, XRP’s role in facilitating quick currency movement becomes more vital, particularly in volatile markets where stablecoins may not be ideal. Schwartz made a subtle but important distinction, saying XRP’s place on XRPL is privileged. With this, the crypto token is less likely to be replaced or worked around, providing a long-term advantage that many other tokens may not have.

2025-08-01 18:00:24,49374903,1754071224,Robin Energy Buys Bitcoin as Treasury Asset as WeWake Presale Coins Lead Walletless Crypto,"Robin Energy invests $5M in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, strengthening its long-term strategy and digital reserve approach. WeWake presale coins fund a gasless Layer 2 blockchain with smart wallets, Paymaster API, and 2026 Mainnet launch plans. WAKE tokenomics allocate 32% to presale coins as WeWake releases its whitepaper and prepares Testnet and ecosystem grants. Robin Energy has adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset with an initial $5 million allocation from its cash reserves. Robin Energy stated that the purchases will be made using a structured and secure approach through qualified custodians. Meanwhile, WeWake has introduced its presale coins, attracting attention with a walletless and gasless blockchain system designed for fast crypto onboarding. Robin Energy Allocates $5 Million to Bitcoin Robin Energy Ltd . confirmed that its board unanimously approved Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. The company announced that it would gradually allocate up to 50% of its long-term reserves into Bitcoin through a dollar-cost averaging plan. Petros Panagiotidis, Chairman and CEO of Robin Energy, said, “We see Bitcoin as a valuable addition for treasury optimization and long-term balance sheet strength.” The company explained that the allocation would not affect operational liquidity or growth strategies. Robin Energy also stated that it would work with qualified digital asset custodians for secure purchases and storage. This approach is aimed at meeting institutional standards while ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. WeWake Presale Coins Drive Walletless Blockchain Adoption WeWake has launched presale coins for its walletless and gasless Layer 2 blockchain, which eliminates traditional onboarding barriers in crypto. Its system allows users to log in through Google or Telegram instead of setting up wallets or managing seed phrases. The platform integrates ERC-4337 smart contract wallets and a Paymaster system that removes the need for upfront gas fees. WeWake confirmed that the whitepaper is available, outlining its approach to simple and secure crypto onboarding. Developers can also integrate the WeWake SDK for instant access to tokens, swaps, and NFTs. WeWake’s presale coins are designed to support ecosystem growth by funding development and incentivizing adoption. The project expects strong interest from developers and non-technical users who want a smooth entry into Web3. Tokenomics and Roadmap of WeWake The WeWake whitepaper reveals that the total supply of WAKE tokens is 308,726,951. About 32% is allocated for the presale coins, 14% for ecosystem incentives, and 12% for treasury and governance. Other allocations include staking rewards, marketing, liquidity, and a strategic reserve. The roadmap shows that WeWake will start its product development phase in Q4 2025. It plans to launch a public testnet in Q1 2026 and a mainnet in Q2 2026. These launches will feature walletless login, gasless swaps, and an SDK for developers. By Q3 2026, WeWake aims to list the WAKE token on major exchanges and onboard partners across e-commerce and Web2 platforms. The presale coins will play a key role in this timeline by supporting early development and network incentives. WeWake also plans a bug bounty campaign, audits, and developer grants before the mainnet launch to strengthen its ecosystem.

2025-08-01 17:55:30,49375699,1754070930,What Bitcoin's Velocity Says About Its Future,"Bitcoin’s on-chain velocity—how often coins move—is at decade lows. To some, that’s a red flag: has Bitcoin lost momentum? Is it still being used? In fact, falling velocity may be the clearest signal yet that Bitcoin is maturing, not stagnating. Instead of circulating like cash, Bitcoin is increasingly being held like gold. A Shift in Function In traditional economics, velocity refers to how often money changes hands; it’s a proxy for economic activity. For Bitcoin, it tracks how frequently BTC is transacted on-chain. In Bitcoin’s early days, coins moved frequently as traders, early adopters, and enthusiasts tested its use cases. During major bull runs, like those in 2013, 2017, and 2021, transaction activity spiked, with BTC flowing quickly between wallets and exchanges. Today, that has changed. More than 70% of BTC hasn't moved in over a year. Transactional churn has slowed. At face value, this could seem like declining usage. But it reflects something else: conviction. Bitcoin is being treated as a long-term asset, not just a short-term currency. And that shift is driven largely by institutions. Institutional Adoption Locks Up Supply Since the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, institutional holdings have soared. As of mid-2025, spot ETFs hold over 1.298 million BTC, approximately 6.2% of total circulating supply. When including corporate treasuries, private companies, and investment funds, total institutional holdings approach 2.55 million BTC around 12.8% of all Bitcoin in circulation. These assets remain largely static, stored in cold wallets as part of long-term strategies. Firms like Strategy and Tesla are not spending their Bitcoin; they’re holding it as a strategic reserve. That’s bullish for scarcity and price. But it also lowers velocity: fewer coins circulating, fewer transactions happening on-chain. Off-Chain Usage Is Rising and Harder to See It’s important to note that on-chain velocity doesn’t capture all of Bitcoin’s economic activity. On-chain velocity only tells part of the story. Increasingly, Bitcoin’s real economic activity is happening off the base layer, and outside traditional measurements. Take the Lightning Network, THE Bitcoin’s Layer-2 scaling solution which enables fast, low-cost payments that bypass the main chain entirely. From streaming micropayments to cross-border remittances, Lightning makes bitcoin usable in everyday scenarios, but its transactions don’t appear in velocity metrics. As of mid-2025, public Lightning capacity surpassed 5,000 BTC, reflecting a nearly 400% increase since 2020. Private channel growth and institutional experimentation suggest the real number is much higher. Similarly, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is enabling BTC to circulate across Ethereum and other chains, fueling DeFi protocols and tokenized finance. In the first half of 2025 alone, WBTC supply grew by 34%, a clear signal that bitcoin is being deployed, not dormant. And then there’s custody: institutional wallets, ETF cold storage, and multisig treasury tools allow firms to hold BTC securely, but often without moving it. These coins may be economically significant, yet they contribute nothing to on-chain velocity. In short, Bitcoin is likely more active than it appears, it’s just happening outside traditional velocity metrics. Its utility is shifting to new layers and platforms- payment rails, smart contract systems, yield strategies—none of which register in traditional velocity models. As Bitcoin evolves into a multi-layer monetary system, we may need new ways to measure its momentum. Falling on-chain velocity doesn’t necessarily mean usage is slowing. In fact, it might just mean we’re looking in the wrong place. The Trade-Off Behind Low Velocity While slow velocity reflects conviction and long-term holding, it also presents a challenge. Fewer on-chain transactions mean fewer fees for miners: a growing concern after the 2024 halving, which cut block rewards in half. Bitcoin’s long-term security model depends on a healthy fee market, which in turn relies on consistent economic activity. There’s also the question of perception. A network where coins rarely move can start to resemble a static vault rather than a dynamic marketplace. That may strengthen the “digital gold” thesis but weakens the vision of bitcoin as usable money. This is the core design tension: Bitcoin aims to be both a store of value (digital gold) and a medium of exchange (peer to peer cash) . But those roles don’t always align. Velocity is the measure of that push and pull, this ongoing struggle between preservation and utility, and how Bitcoin navigates it will shape not just usage patterns, but its role in the broader financial system. A Sign of Maturity In the end, falling velocity doesn’t mean Bitcoin is being used less. It means it’s being used differently. As Bitcoin gains value, people are more inclined to save it than spend it. As adoption grows, infrastructure moves off-chain. And as institutions enter, their strategies center on preservation, not circulation. The Bitcoin network is evolving. Velocity isn’t vanishing; it’s going silent, reshaped by a changing user base and new layers of economic activity. If velocity ticks up again, it could mark a resurgence of transactional use; more spending, more movement, more retail involvement. If it stays low, it suggests Bitcoin’s role as macro collateral is taking firm root. Either way, velocity offers a window into Bitcoin’s future. Not as a coin to spend, but as an asset to build on.",Opinion|Opinion,EN,1,bitcoin often coin decade low red flag bitcoin lost momentum still used fact falling velocity may clearest signal yet bitcoin maturing stagnating instead circulating like cash bitcoin increasingly held like gold shift function traditional economics velocity refers often money change hand proxy economic activity bitcoin track frequently btc transacted bitcoin early day coin moved frequently trader early adopter enthusiast tested use case major bull run like transaction activity spiked btc flowing quickly wallet exchange today changed btc moved year transactional churn slowed face value could seem like declining usage reflects something else conviction bitcoin treated asset currency shift driven largely institution institutional adoption lock supply since launch u spot bitcoin etf institutional holding soared spot etf hold million btc approximately total circulating supply including corporate treasury private company investment fund total institutional holding approach million btc around bitcoin circulation asset remain largely static stored cold wallet part strategy firm like strategy tesla spending bitcoin holding strategic reserve bullish scarcity price also lower velocity fewer coin circulating fewer transaction happening usage rising harder see important note velocity capture bitcoin economic activity velocity tell part story increasingly bitcoin real economic activity happening base layer outside traditional measurement take lightning network bitcoin scaling solution enables fast payment bypass main chain entirely streaming micropayments remittance lightning make bitcoin usable everyday scenario transaction appear velocity metric public lightning capacity surpassed btc reflecting nearly increase since private channel growth institutional experimentation suggest real number much higher similarly wrapped bitcoin wbtc enabling btc circulate across ethereum chain fueling defi protocol tokenized finance first half alone wbtc supply grew clear signal bitcoin deployed dormant custody institutional wallet etf cold storage multisig treasury tool allow firm hold btc securely often without moving coin may economically significant yet contribute nothing velocity short bitcoin likely active appears happening outside traditional velocity metric utility shifting new layer payment rail smart contract system yield register traditional velocity model bitcoin evolves monetary system may need new way measure momentum falling velocity necessarily mean usage slowing fact might mean looking wrong place behind low velocity slow velocity reflects conviction holding also present challenge fewer transaction mean fewer fee miner growing concern halving cut block reward half bitcoin security model depends healthy fee market turn relies consistent economic activity also question perception network coin rarely move start resemble static vault rather dynamic marketplace may strengthen digital gold thesis weakens vision bitcoin usable money core design tension bitcoin aim store value digital gold medium exchange peer peer cash role always align velocity measure push pull ongoing struggle preservation utility bitcoin navigates shape usage pattern role broader financial system sign maturity end falling velocity mean bitcoin used less mean used differently bitcoin gain value people inclined save spend adoption grows infrastructure move institution enter strategy center preservation circulation bitcoin network evolving velocity vanishing going silent reshaped changing user base new layer economic activity velocity tick could mark resurgence transactional use spending movement retail involvement stay low suggests bitcoin role macro collateral taking firm root either way velocity offer window bitcoin future coin spend asset build,0.056,0.776,0.168,0.9953,1
2025-08-01 17:55:11,49373940,1754070911,Upbit TIA Suspension: Critical Alert for Celestia Holders,"BitcoinWorld Upbit TIA Suspension: Critical Alert for Celestia Holders The dynamic world of cryptocurrency often moves at a rapid pace, with new developments emerging constantly. However, sometimes, the gears grind to a halt, prompting an urgent need for attention from traders and investors. Recently, a significant event unfolded in the South Korean crypto market, directly impacting users of one of the nation’s largest exchanges. We are referring to the unexpected Upbit TIA suspension , which has temporarily halted the flow of Celestia (TIA) tokens on the platform. For many, such an announcement can trigger immediate concerns about asset safety and accessibility. Understanding the nuances of why an exchange might implement an Upbit TIA suspension is crucial for navigating the crypto landscape with confidence. This article will delve into the specifics of this event, its implications, and what Celestia holders should know. What Exactly Caused the Upbit TIA Suspension? South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit made an official announcement detailing the temporary suspension of Celestia (TIA) deposits and withdrawals. The primary reason cited for this measure was issues related to its blockchain node. A blockchain node is a fundamental component of a cryptocurrency network; it is a computer that maintains a copy of the blockchain and helps to validate transactions and blocks. When a node experiences issues, such as synchronization problems, network congestion, or software bugs, it can disrupt the smooth flow of operations. For an exchange like Upbit, maintaining a stable and synchronized node is paramount for accurately processing user transactions and ensuring the integrity of the funds. The Upbit TIA suspension was a proactive step to prevent potential discrepancies or losses during this technical instability. This situation highlights the technical complexities involved in running a major cryptocurrency exchange. Even with robust infrastructure, unforeseen technical glitches can occur, necessitating temporary halts to protect user assets and maintain system integrity. Upbit has stated that services will resume once the stability of the blockchain node is fully restored. The following table summarizes the immediate impact: Service Affected Current Status Reason for Upbit TIA Suspension Celestia (TIA) Deposits Temporarily Suspended Blockchain Node Issues Celestia (TIA) Withdrawals Temporarily Suspended Blockchain Node Issues Celestia (TIA) Trading Unaffected (Continues) Separate Operational Mechanism Why is an Upbit TIA Suspension a Big Deal for Traders? Any service suspension on a major cryptocurrency exchange can send ripples through the market and create anxiety among users. An Upbit TIA suspension , even if temporary, carries several implications for traders and the broader crypto community: Liquidity Concerns: For traders who rely on seamless deposits and withdrawals to manage their portfolios, a suspension means their funds are effectively locked on the exchange for that specific asset. This can hinder their ability to react to market changes or move assets to other platforms for different opportunities. Market Volatility: While trading for TIA on Upbit may continue, the inability to deposit or withdraw can impact supply and demand dynamics, potentially leading to increased price volatility. Traders might be forced to make decisions based on limited options. Trust and Confidence: Frequent or prolonged suspensions, regardless of the reason, can erode user trust in an exchange. Users expect reliability and transparency, especially when dealing with their financial assets. Upbit’s swift communication helps mitigate this, but the event itself highlights the inherent risks of centralized platforms. Opportunity Cost: Users holding TIA on Upbit cannot transfer their tokens to other exchanges or personal wallets during the suspension. This might mean missing out on staking rewards, arbitrage opportunities, or participation in other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. It is a stark reminder that while centralized exchanges offer convenience, they also come with a degree of control over user assets during specific events. The Upbit TIA suspension serves as a practical example of this operational reality. What is Celestia (TIA), and Why is it Important? To fully grasp the context of the Upbit TIA suspension , it is helpful to understand Celestia itself. Celestia is a groundbreaking modular blockchain network designed to revolutionize how blockchains are built and scaled. Unlike monolithic blockchains that handle all functions (execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability) in one layer, Celestia specializes in one critical aspect: data availability. Here is why Celestia and its native token, TIA, are considered important in the evolving blockchain landscape: Modular Blockchain Architecture: Celestia introduces the concept of modular blockchains, allowing developers to deploy their own execution layers (rollups, app-chains) that can then use Celestia for data availability. This separation of concerns aims to improve scalability, flexibility, and sovereignty for decentralized applications. Data Availability Sampling (DAS): Celestia uses a novel technique called Data Availability Sampling, which allows light clients to verify that all transaction data is available without downloading the entire blockchain. This is crucial for the security and efficiency of rollups built on top of Celestia. Enabling Scalability: By offloading the data availability burden, Celestia allows other blockchain layers to focus solely on execution, leading to significantly higher transaction throughput and lower costs. This is vital for the mass adoption of blockchain technology. TIA Token Utility: The TIA token is integral to the Celestia ecosystem. It is used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and participating in governance decisions. Its utility underpins the economic model of the modular blockchain paradigm. Celestia represents a significant step forward in blockchain scalability solutions, making its token, TIA, a notable asset in the crypto space. The Upbit TIA suspension , therefore, impacts an asset that is central to a key area of blockchain innovation. How Can You Navigate an Upbit TIA Suspension? When an exchange announces a service suspension, it is natural to feel a sense of uncertainty. However, panic is rarely the best course of action. Here are some actionable insights for users affected by the Upbit TIA suspension or similar future events: Stay Informed Through Official Channels: Always prioritize information directly from Upbit’s official website, announcements page, or verified social media accounts. Avoid relying on unverified rumors or third-party reports that could be inaccurate. Understand the Nature of the Suspension: Differentiate between a temporary technical halt and a more severe, long-term issue. In this case, Upbit has clearly stated it is due to blockchain node stability and is temporary. Assess Your Immediate Needs: Do you need to access your TIA immediately for a specific transaction or opportunity? If not, patience is often the best strategy. For many, simply waiting for the issue to be resolved is the most prudent approach. Avoid Hasty Decisions: Do not attempt to move funds via unofficial means or engage in panic selling. Such actions can lead to losses or expose you to scams. Review Your Overall Portfolio: Use this as an opportunity to review your diversification strategy. Relying heavily on a single exchange or asset can increase your exposure to such events. Consider Self-Custody: For long-term holders, consider moving a portion of your assets to a hardware wallet or other self-custody solutions when services resume. This gives you direct control over your private keys and reduces reliance on exchanges. Proactive monitoring and a calm, informed approach are key to managing any Upbit TIA suspension or similar crypto market disruption. What Are Crypto Exchanges Doing During an Upbit TIA Suspension? Behind the scenes of an Upbit TIA suspension , exchange operators and their technical teams are working diligently to resolve the underlying issues. Running a cryptocurrency exchange involves managing complex systems, including thousands of blockchain nodes, vast databases, and high-volume transaction processing engines. When a blockchain node encounters problems, the exchange’s immediate priorities are: Diagnosis and Resolution: Technical teams are focused on identifying the root cause of the blockchain node instability. This could involve debugging software, updating configurations, or even replacing hardware components. Their goal is to restore the node to a stable, synchronized state as quickly as possible. Security and Integrity: During any technical issue, the paramount concern is the security of user funds and the integrity of the transaction ledger. Suspensions like the Upbit TIA suspension are often implemented as a preventative measure to ensure no funds are lost or corrupted during the instability. Communication with Users: Responsible exchanges, like Upbit, prioritize clear and timely communication. They issue public announcements to inform users about the issue, its nature, and what steps are being taken. Regular updates help manage user expectations and reduce anxiety. Testing and Verification: Before resuming services, the exchange will conduct thorough testing to ensure the blockchain node is fully stable and operational. This includes verifying synchronization, processing test transactions, and confirming data integrity. This meticulous process ensures that once services are back online, they remain reliable. Such incidents are a testament to the ongoing challenges in maintaining cutting-edge financial infrastructure in the rapidly evolving crypto space. Exchanges are continuously investing in robust systems and protocols to minimize downtime and enhance reliability. What’s Next After the Upbit TIA Suspension? Following an Upbit TIA suspension , the immediate next step is the resumption of services. Upbit has explicitly stated that deposits and withdrawals for Celestia (TIA) will be enabled once the blockchain node stability is fully restored. This typically involves a comprehensive internal review and testing phase to ensure that the underlying technical issues have been completely resolved and that the network is operating optimally. Users should remain vigilant and continue to monitor Upbit’s official announcement channels. Once the suspension is lifted, the exchange will likely issue another update confirming the resumption of services. At that point, users will be able to proceed with their TIA deposits and withdrawals as normal. It is important to remember that such technical pauses are not uncommon in the crypto industry, which operates on decentralized networks that can occasionally experience synchronization or connectivity issues. The swift and transparent action taken by Upbit in implementing the Upbit TIA suspension demonstrates their commitment to maintaining a secure and reliable trading environment for their users. Conclusion The temporary Upbit TIA suspension of Celestia (TIA) deposits and withdrawals serves as a timely reminder of the operational realities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While inconvenient for users, such measures are often necessary to safeguard assets and ensure the long-term stability of trading platforms. Upbit’s proactive response to its blockchain node issues underscores its commitment to user security and service integrity. For Celestia holders and the broader crypto community, this event highlights the importance of staying informed, understanding the underlying technology, and practicing sound risk management. As the crypto space continues to mature, we can expect exchanges to continually refine their infrastructure and communication protocols to minimize such disruptions. The core message remains: transparency and technical diligence are paramount in the world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Celestia (TIA)?

According to the analysis, the price of Bitcoin suddenly jumped from $112,000 to $115,800 on July 10, 2025. However, it was claimed that this rise lacked robust technical and on-chain data. CryptoQuant analysts note that no support levels have emerged due to the price's rapid rise between these levels. According to onchain data, there is no significant trading volume or strong demand signals in the $112,000 to $115,800 range. Technically, there is no solid ground to hold the price at this time, as there has been no prior consolidation or resistance in this region. Related News: Major Split Within the Fed - Two Members Begin to Oppose Chair Jerome Powell, Here Are Their Statements While this wasn't a problem during the rally, it became a significant risk factor as the price turned lower. According to the analysis, Bitcoin is currently sitting at its last known support level, supported by on-chain data, “like a shelf with nothing underneath.” If this last support level is broken, the price is expected to move downward at the same rate. As long as the support level holds, there is no problem, but investors are advised to exercise caution, set stop-loss orders, and closely monitor price movements.

2025-08-01 17:50:05,49373738,1754070605,"$250 Investment to Explosive Gains with Ozak AI and Avalanche,  Will This AI Presale Altcoin Create History?","The cryptocurrency market continues to present opportunities for strategic investors exploring emerging technologies and platforms. The journey that $250 investment makes to significant returns is slowly catching on with projects like Ozak AI and Avalanche (AVAX) that are receiving their fair share of media attention due to the respective breakthroughs in the fields of decentralized AI and scalable blockchain environments. With investors increasingly positioning themselves to use means of turning novel ideas into structured growth through a potent mixture of utility and innovation, both Avalanche and Ozak AI orchestrate developments that necessitate tracking. Ozak AI: PreSale Development and Economics Ozak AI is a blockchain-based artificial intelligence provider that deals with predictive systems and implementations of the same into the existing infrastructural networks. The platform transforms the concept of decentralized data through the assistance of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) and OSN (Ozak Stream Network). These components allow the platform to deliver autonomous financial analytics through tamper-proof data streaming and storage. Currently in the fourth stage of its presale , the $OZ token is priced at $0.005. Early investors who purchased at previous stages have already seen price appreciation, with the upcoming final presale stage listing tokens at $0.01. The presale began at $0.001 and has raised over $1.50 million. Approximately 60,767,244.712 tokens have been sold from the current allotment of 200 million. The initial presale is built to give a benefit to the first people with tier pricing, offering a vision of future profit that can be generated out of an initial investment that would be as low as $250. There is a total supply of 10 billion of the $OZ token and of this, 3 billion are designated for presale contributors, another 3 billion for ecosystem and community use, and the remainder is split as follows: 2 billion for reserves, one billion for liquidity, and one billion for team allocations. This transparent allocation supports long-term sustainability and operational development. Ozak AI’s Technological Framework and Use Cases Ozak AI uses blockchain technology alongside AI and decentralized data processing to produce an environment where real-time and reliable decisions can be made. The DePIN framework provides data distribution storage using both IPFS and blockchain and enables an elastic addition of new nodes without affecting performance. Smart contracts specify access rules to any data, and each transaction is written in an immutable ledger. The OSN aspect verifies data and makes it reliable, something essential in financial modeling and predictive analysis applications. It facilitates enterprise applications such as on-chain computation and market forecasting, which is enabled by the Prediction Agent on the same platform. These applications will enable Ozak AI to be adopted in various businesses that involve autonomous data-driven decision mechanisms. Avalanche (AVAX): Stable Performance in a Volatile Market Avalanche (AVAX), with its high-throughput system capable of smart contracts, is retaining the faith of investors facing volatility in the market. At the last trading cycle, AVAX had a price of $24.72, and the daily price dip was 9,35%. The market cap is already at the level of $10.44 billion, and the number of trades within a 24-hour timeframe increased by 17.94% and is currently at the level of 993 million dollars. Source: CoinMarketCap However, in spite of the volatility within the day, where the token went as far as $27, it stabilized to above $25.50. Its circulating supply is 422.27 million, and it has a total supply of 457.27 million. An increase in trading activity of 17.94% and a ratio of volume to market cap of 9.79% shows that the traders are active and that the investors have been active so far, especially those monitoring the network scalability and speed of execution of smart contracts. Having already maintained the same technical advancement and market strength, Avalanche remains one of the best pairings for the younger projects in terms of those who want to diversify crypto holdings today.

2025-08-01 17:48:28,49373708,1754070508,Indonesia’s Crypto Tax Revenue Skyrockets 181% – But Volatility Raises Red Flags,"Indonesia’s annual crypto tax revenue jumped sharply in 2024, marking its highest level since the government introduced taxation on digital assets in 2022. According to officials from the Directorate General of Taxes, the country collected 620 billion rupiah (around $38 million) last year, a 181% rise from the 220 billion rupiah recorded in 2023. The sharp increase reflects a broader surge in local crypto activity. Officials attributed the growth to a rise in transaction volumes, which reportedly reached 650 trillion rupiah ($39.67 billion) in 2024. This aligns with Indonesia’s growing crypto user base, which now stands at over 20 million people, surpassing the number of stock market investors. Crypto Tax Revenue in Indonesia Surged in 2024, but 2025 Off to a Slower Start However, the momentum may not last. Year-to-date figures for 2025 show a steep drop in tax revenue, with collections sitting at just 115 billion rupiah ($6.97 million) as of July. Officials point to crypto market volatility as a key factor behind the fluctuations. “Crypto is a long-term investment. The price can drop,” said Hestu Yoga Saksama, Director of Tax Regulations I at the Directorate General of Taxes. “It could spike, it could drop—it depends on what kind of fever it is. If the fever is high, then the reception will be good.” The tax was first introduced in 2022 and includes both Final Value Added Tax (VAT) and Article 22 Income Tax on crypto trading. In its first year, crypto taxes brought in 246 billion rupiah. The drop in 2023 raised concerns before the market rebounded sharply last year. To manage this growing sector, the government introduced several new regulations in 2025. Among them are updated ministerial decrees that set out tax rules for crypto asset trading and amend existing tax frameworks to reflect the evolving digital asset space. Indonesia has also reclassified crypto assets from commodities to financial assets. This move brings the sector under the oversight of the Financial Services Authority (OJK), indicating a shift in how the country views crypto’s role in its broader financial system. Yon Arsal, an advisor to the Minister of Finance, emphasized the need for collaboration. “It’s not enough to simply expand the scope,” he said. “We must also coordinate. We’re encouraging better coordination with our external stakeholders, including the Financial Services Authority.” Indonesia Raises Crypto Taxes on Foreign Exchanges, Cuts VAT for Buyers The government also rolled out tax reforms in August designed to shift activity toward domestic crypto platforms. Taxes on foreign exchanges were raised from 0.2% to 1%, while domestic platforms saw a smaller hike from 0.1% to 0.21%. Buyers, however, are no longer subject to VAT, creating an incentive for local trading. Crypto mining operations weren’t left out. VAT on mining has doubled from 1.1% to 2.2%, and a special 0.1% income tax for miners will be removed in 2026. After that, mining income will be taxed under regular personal or corporate tax rates. Speaking to CryptoNews, Gregory Cowles, Chief Strategy Officer of Intellistake.ai , noted that “crypto taxation needs to strike a balance. It’s fair that governments want their share, but overly aggressive or unclear policies risk pushing users offshore or into informal channels.” He continued, saying, “Especially in emerging markets, crypto is often more than just speculation; it’s a workaround for currency instability or limited access to banking. If taxation becomes too punitive, it could stifle that utility.” Indonesia implements sweeping cryptocurrency tax increases up to five times higher effective August 1 targeting the booming $39.67 billion crypto market. #Indonesia #Crypto https://t.co/INFY07kh8f — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Despite the volatility challenges, officials view crypto taxation as a growing source of revenue. The government’s ability to capture earnings from the booming digital asset market, particularly among younger investors aged 18 to 30, is seen as a long-term opportunity. Still, the unpredictable nature of crypto prices poses a challenge for revenue planning. As Yoga noted, “It really depends on the market. If activity drops, so does the revenue.” As 2025 unfolds, the country’s crypto tax collections may continue to reflect the highs and lows of a volatile but rapidly expanding sector. Gregory Cowles further noted that “If governments start to treat crypto tax income as a stable budget item, they may be setting themselves up for disappointment.” Indonesia Ranks 3rd Globally for Crypto Adoption as Youth Trading Soars Indonesia’s crypto sector is seeing a sharp rise in activity, fueled largely by its young population. Over 60% of the country’s crypto investors are aged between 18 and 30, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti). This surge in young investor participation has helped position Indonesia as the third-highest country on Chainalysis’s Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index . Source: Chainalysis In 2024, Indonesia recorded more than $30 billion in crypto transactions by October , a steep rise from $6.5 billion the previous year. While still below the 2021 peak of $54 billion, this marks a 352% year-over-year increase. The number of registered crypto traders in the country also grew, reaching 21 million. At the regulatory level, the country is undergoing a shift in oversight. The transfer of authority from Bappebti to the Financial Services Authority (OJK), initially planned for January 2025 , was delayed due to the absence of supporting government regulations. Indonesia’s crypto regulation transfer to OJK, set for Jan. 12, faces setbacks due to incomplete government frameworks. #Indonesia #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/2V7xIu94eI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 2, 2025 Once finalized, the OJK is expected to provide a more structured regulatory framework aligned with global standards, including clearer rules on trading, taxation, and exchange operations.

2025-08-01 17:43:49,49375696,1754070229,"Red Coin, Blue Coin: The New Politics of Exposure","It was only a matter of time. With Strategy long reigning as the go-to corporate proxy for bitcoin exposure, it was inevitable that a challenger would emerge — though few expected it to wear a red hat and run a social media company. Trump Media & Technology Group’s recent announcement that it holds roughly $2 billion in bitcoin has transformed it, overnight, into a serious — if unconventional — bitcoin-treasury company. But for investors seeking crypto exposure, the question isn’t just about how much bitcoin a company holds. It’s about what else comes with the package. In one corner, we have Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy): the bitcoin standard-bearer, helmed by Michael Saylor, who has spent the past four years turning a sleepy enterprise software company into a de facto digital gold vault. Saylor has become bitcoin’s most prominent corporate evangelist, turning Strategy into a digital gold vault with quarterly earnings calls that double as bitcoin sermons. In the other corner, enter Trump Media (DJT) , which operates the Truth Social platform and has a revenue stream you could mistake for a rounding error: $4.1 million in 2023 , compared to Strategy’s $498 million . Yet its market cap has floated above $6 billion — a valuation propped up almost entirely by brand loyalty, media spectacle, and now, bitcoin. Let’s be clear: DJT didn’t just buy some bitcoin. It bought a lot of it — enough to vault it into the upper echelon of corporate BTC holders . On paper, that makes it interesting. But this isn’t your typical balance-sheet play. This is bitcoin by way of meme stock, populist vehicle, and culture war capital. And for investors looking for crypto exposure, it raises an uncomfortable — and increasingly unavoidable — question: What happens when your bitcoin proxy stock comes with a political identity? Strategy’s bitcoin play, while bold, has always been pitched as a rational (some might say religious) hedge against inflation and fiat debasement. Its founder doesn’t dabble in politics (outside of poking fun at altcoins ), and the company isn’t staging rallies or trending on Truth Social. It’s all-in on bitcoin — not ideology. Trump Media, by contrast, is ideology-first. Its brand, valuation, and customer base are inseparable from Donald Trump’s political identity. With bitcoin now making up the overwhelming majority of the company’s assets, this is less a treasury decision than a wholesale pivot. But in practice, it functions more like a cultural signal — a declaration of alignment with the anti-establishment, pro-sovereignty values that animate its most loyal followers. That’s not a bad strategy, necessarily. It might even be a brilliant one. The marriage of Trumpism and bitcoin isn’t as odd as it sounds. Both reject centralized authority. Both thrive on defiance. Both are, depending on your viewpoint, revolutionary or rebellious — and always controversial. But for investors who simply want crypto exposure in their portfolio, the emergence of politically branded bitcoin stocks presents a new kind of risk. What happens when bitcoin becomes tribal ? What happens when each side of the political aisle has its own bitcoin company, its own bitcoin ETF, its own financial media ecosystem? In this new paradigm, bitcoin exposure could become not just a financial choice, but a cultural affiliation. Imagine a left-leaning climate-tech firm launching “Green Bitcoin Holdings, Inc.” to push eco-friendly mining . Or a libertarian group creating “Freedom Ledger Corp.” to promote bitcoin as a tool for tax resistance and personal sovereignty. Bitcoin could become the financial equivalent of cable news: red coins, blue coins, and perpetual outrage. That’s a far cry from bitcoin’s original promise as a neutral , decentralized alternative to fiat. It was supposed to be trustless. Borderless. Immune to capture. But when its biggest corporate champions start behaving like political action committees it threatens to drag bitcoin into the very systems it was designed to transcend. So where does that leave investors? If you’re looking for a relatively clean bitcoin proxy, Strategy still offers the clearest path. Its volatility is real — but it’s the volatility of conviction. Trump Media, on the other hand, is a bet on narrative, loyalty, and virality. It might outperform in the short term. It might even spark a whole new class of politically-infused crypto equities. But it’s no longer just about bitcoin. It’s about who owns the story around bitcoin. The final irony? Bitcoin itself doesn’t care. It doesn’t care who your CEO is. It doesn’t care who your president is. It just keeps producing blocks, one every ten minutes, indifferent to spin, slogans, or Senate hearings (until 21 million is reached – at which point the political tribe with the biggest BTC treasury wins?). But investors do care.

2025-08-01 17:40:10,49373392,1754070010,Gate US Unleashes Historic Crypto Trading Opportunities in 2025,"BitcoinWorld Gate US Unleashes Historic Crypto Trading Opportunities in 2025 The cryptocurrency landscape in the United States is poised for a significant transformation. Imagine a scenario where a leading global crypto exchange, Gate.io, officially steps onto American soil, bringing its robust platform and extensive range of digital assets to a market eager for innovation. This is precisely what is unfolding, with Gate US launching spot crypto trading for American customers. This pivotal move is not just a strategic expansion for Gate.io; it signals a new era for crypto accessibility and regulatory clarity in the U.S., particularly as we look towards 2025 and beyond. What Does the Launch of Gate US Mean for American Investors? The entry of Gate US into the American market is a direct response to a much-improved regulatory environment. For years, the U.S. crypto space has been characterized by uncertainty, often hindering global players from offering their full suite of services. However, 2025 is anticipated to bring forth clearer guidelines and a more accommodating framework, paving the way for platforms like Gate US to operate with greater confidence and compliance. This development is crucial for several reasons: Increased Accessibility: American investors will gain access to a wider array of digital assets and trading pairs, potentially diversifying their portfolios beyond what is currently available on some domestic platforms. Enhanced Competition: The arrival of Gate US will undoubtedly intensify competition among crypto exchanges in the U.S. This competition often translates to better services, lower fees, and more innovative product offerings for users. Regulatory Compliance Focus: Gate.io’s decision to enter the U.S. market underscores its commitment to operating within established regulatory frameworks. This move can build greater trust among users and regulators alike, fostering a more secure trading environment. The shift in the regulatory climate is not merely about relaxation; it’s about clarity. When rules are well-defined, businesses can invest and innovate with less risk, ultimately benefiting consumers. The proactive steps taken by Gate.io to establish Gate US demonstrate foresight and adaptability in navigating complex legal landscapes. How Will Gate US Navigate the Competitive Landscape? The U.S. crypto market is vibrant but also highly competitive, with several established exchanges already serving millions of users. Gate US will need a robust strategy to carve out its niche. Here’s a look at how it might approach this challenge: Aspect Gate US Strategy Product Offering Focus on a broad selection of spot trading pairs, potentially including some less common assets approved for U.S. trading. Security & Compliance Emphasize robust security protocols and strict adherence to U.S. regulatory requirements, including AML/KYC. User Experience Provide an intuitive platform, competitive fee structures, and responsive customer support tailored for American users. Market Penetration Target specific demographics or niche markets, potentially through strategic partnerships or localized marketing campaigns. The success of Gate US will largely depend on its ability to differentiate itself while maintaining the high standards of security and compliance expected by U.S. regulators and users. Building trust will be paramount, especially given the history of regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. What Are the Anticipated Benefits of Gate US for the Wider Crypto Ecosystem? Beyond direct benefits to individual investors, the entry of a major player like Gate US can have ripple effects across the entire U.S. crypto ecosystem. It signifies a maturation of the market and an increasing global confidence in its future. Increased Liquidity: More exchanges mean more trading volume, which generally leads to deeper liquidity for various digital assets. This can reduce price volatility and improve execution for traders. Innovation and Development: The heightened competition spurred by Gate US can drive other exchanges to innovate faster, leading to better technology, more user-friendly interfaces, and a wider range of financial products. Regulatory Precedent: A successful and compliant operation by Gate US could set a positive precedent, encouraging other international exchanges to consider entering the U.S. market. This could further solidify the U.S. as a global hub for crypto innovation. Job Creation: Establishing operations in the U.S. will likely lead to the creation of new jobs in various sectors, including technology, compliance, customer service, and marketing. This expansion isn’t just about trading; it’s about building a more robust and resilient financial infrastructure that integrates digital assets into the mainstream economy. The confidence shown by Gate.io in establishing Gate US is a strong indicator of this evolving landscape. What Challenges Might Gate US Face in the U.S. Market? While the regulatory environment is improving, it’s not without its complexities. Gate US will still need to navigate a nuanced landscape, including: State-Specific Regulations: The U.S. has a patchwork of state-level regulations in addition to federal guidelines. Obtaining licenses and operating compliantly in multiple states can be a significant hurdle. Consumer Protection: U.S. regulators place a strong emphasis on consumer protection. Gate US will need to demonstrate robust measures to safeguard user funds and data, as well as clear dispute resolution mechanisms. Public Perception: Overcoming any lingering skepticism about crypto exchanges, especially those with international roots, will require consistent communication and transparent operations. Talent Acquisition: Building a strong local team with expertise in both crypto and U.S. regulatory compliance will be critical. Successfully addressing these challenges will be key to the long-term viability and growth of Gate US in the American market. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto with Gate US The entry of Gate US marks a significant milestone in the journey of cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. It reflects a growing consensus that digital assets are here to stay and that a clear regulatory framework is essential for their responsible growth. As 2025 approaches, the anticipation around this launch highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto industry and its continuous evolution. For American investors, this means more choices, potentially better services, and a more competitive marketplace. For the broader industry, it signifies a move towards greater legitimacy and integration into the global financial system. The success of Gate US could very well pave the way for further international participation, fostering an even more interconnected and liquid global crypto market. This development is a testament to the persistent efforts of industry advocates and policymakers working towards a balanced and innovative approach to digital asset regulation. The stage is set for Gate US to play a crucial role in shaping the next chapter of crypto in America. *** Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Gate US 1. What is Gate US?

Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a crypto commentator on X, drew attention to this development, noting that a monthly close at $3.0599 or above would break XRP’s record. At the time of his post, XRP had just over two hours left in the trading session, and traded at $3.0599, with the community anticipating a new record to add to XRP’s list of accolades in 2025. If XRP closes today at this level or higher, that’ll be the highest monthly close for XRP ever. 2.5 hours to go. pic.twitter.com/4yEaPKgppn — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) July 31, 2025 A Historic Year for XRP 2025 has been a remarkable year for XRP. The asset began the year by hitting a multi-year peak of $3.39, and sustained that momentum throughout January. After spending 16 consecutive days above $3, the asset experienced its highest monthly close , ending January at $3.0354. Although the asset experienced a decline in the following months, it began building back up and closed the second quarter of 2025 at around $2.4, marking its highest quarterly close in history . Following this feat, XRP experienced a massive surge in July, rising to a new all-time high of $3.65, outperforming many altcoins and surpassing expectations. Shortly after, the asset experienced its second-highest weekly close . Very few assets can boast of a similar list of accomplishments, and many experts believe XRP is just getting started. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Multi-Year Resistance Finally Breached According to the chart, XRP has now broken above a multi-year range that capped price action since early 2018. This recent move began earlier in 2025 and accelerated over the past month. Xoom’s visual analysis hints at a structural similarity to the 2017 breakout. This suggests that the current rally could be more than a short-term spike. The 36.79% gain this month alone reflects a sharp acceleration in momentum. While XRP has historically been known for volatile moves, sustained strength into its highest monthly close, especially after years of stagnation, is an extremely bullish sign. If this close holds, it effectively validates the breakout from a high timeframe perspective and could mark the start of a massive bull run targeting higher levels. Analysts and market participants will watch closely to see if this momentum persists into August. Any further continuation would need to contend with psychological levels above $3.5 and, eventually, the all-time high at $3.65 .

First presale participants can secure tokens at prices up to 50% lower than subsequent phase participants.

2025-08-01 07:30:00,49348152,1754033400,Top Cryptocurrency to Invest in as Ethereum (ETH) Rise Boosts Altcoin Market,"Ethereum’s bullish breakout has reignited the altcoin market, and investors are racing to reposition before the next wave hits. But while ETH’s momentum is lifting the tide, one name is turning heads for all the right reasons, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance costs $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. The price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 in the following phase. Buyers who invest now are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment when the project hits the launch price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance has sold over $13.8 million and has recorded over 14,700 investors. As capital flows back into high-potential plays, now’s the moment to get ahead of the curve. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum as Phase 6 Goes Live Mutuum Finance is making waves in presale, selling out the 5th phase before time. The project is already in phase 6 at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is reshaping the DeFi space by creating a scalable financial system with real-world uses. The presale has onboarded more than 14,700 token holders and raised more than $13.8 million. $100,000 Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has also organized a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be given $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is a testament to how the project is committed to building a long-term and dedicated community. CertiK-Powered Bug Bounty Boosts DeFi Security In further efforts towards providing its transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project team will reward a maximum of $50,000 USDT to those who identify likely vulnerabilities in the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to have a right coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is partitioned into the four severity classes; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the team’s commitment towards the security of ecosystem as well as investors’ trust. Next-Gen Dual-Lending Solutions Mutuum Finance is a top DeFi platform wherein the users are still in full control of their assets. The platform employs a double-lending process to provide flexibility as well as the effectiveness which entails Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract employs self-executing smart contracts that carry out the lending automatically with no human intervention. They are programmed to respond to changing market prices based on a floating rate of interest governed by the then-existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the intermediaries and stands a possibility of being directly linked with borrowers and lenders. It is more common in meme coins because it stands a possibility of having specific terms of a loan and adaptability based on the willingness of a user to take risk. Ethereum’s breakout is lighting up the altcoin market, but the real story could be unfolding with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As capital rotates into high-upside plays, MUTM has already attracted over 14,700 investors, raising $13.8 million+ and delivering serious momentum in its Phase 6 presale at $0.035.

Combined with a CertiK-backed $50,000 Bug Bounty, dual lending models, and a $100,000 token giveaway, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most robust and rewarding DeFi launches of 2025.

2025-08-01 07:27:26,49348010,1754033246,$600M in Longs Wiped as BTC Crashes to 3-Week Low on Trump Tariff Shock,"Today, being August 1, means that many of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs against multiple nations are supposed to be enforced, which had a drastic impact on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, for one, dropped by several grand in a day to a multi-week low of under $114,500. Trump’s Latest Tariff Adjustments August 1 was a pivotal date for Trump’s global policy, as he had outlined it as a deadline for tariff implementation against numerous nations. On Thursday, the POTUS signed an executive order to change the stipulations. For one, he imposed a 10% tariff on goods imported from every country, aside from the 92 nations listed in an annex that are subject to higher rates. Trump also raised tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%. “I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners,” the POTUS said . Many economic experts rushed to offer their insights on what the actual impact would be on the financial markets, including crypto. The Kobeissi Letter, for instance, noted that the trade war has “lost all credibility.” The market says the trade war has lost all credibility: President Trump just seemingly just randomly decided to raise tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%. On top of this, he imposed “reciprocal tariffs” on Vietnam, Switzerland, South Africa, Taiwan, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia,… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 1, 2025 But Crypto Corrects Recall that the entire crypto market plunged hard in April following Trump’s original tariff call. At the time, BTC went from a six-digit territory to a five-month low of under $75,000 within days as the market wiped out nearly half a trillion dollars. The landscape, for now at least, is not as painful, but BTC and the altcoins are still in the red after Trump’s executive order. Bitcoin’s price had recovered to almost $119,000 yesterday after the Fed’s decision to maintain the interest rates, but dumped by more than four grand to a multi-week low of $114,400. Although it has recovered some ground since then, it’s still more than 3% down on the day. The altcoins have it even worse, with ETH and XRP dropping by 6%, while SPX, ENA, CRV, INJ, PENGU, JUP, BONK, SEI, and several others have nosedived by double digits. The total crypto market cap has seen over $150 billion gone since yesterday’s peak and is down to $3.820 trillion on CG. BTCUSD.

2025-08-01 07:27:21,49362758,1754033241,"Grayscale, VanEck, and Others Update Solana ETF Filings in Push for SEC Approval","Several asset managers have revised their filings for Solana exchange-traded funds, signaling forward movement toward potential approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This week, several leading financial firms, including Fidelity, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, CoinShares, Canary Capital, and VanEck, submitted revised proposals to the U.S. SEC as part of a renewed bid to introduce spot Solana ETFs.The updated S-1 registration statements reflect what market observers interpret as constructive engagement between issuers and the SEC. In a post on X, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth, noted that the amendments are relatively minor. However, he suggested they reflect a back-and-forth process aimed at refining prospectus language and meeting regulatory expectations.Grayscale Discloses Fee StructureFor context, Grayscale stated that it intends to charge a 2.5% management fee for its Solana fund, payable not in fiat, but directly in SOL tokens. This approach aligns with Grayscale’s broader crypto-native strategy and offers a potential differentiator in an increasingly crowded ETF landscape.Growing Pipeline of Crypto ETF ProposalsBeyond firm-level adjustments, the SEC is reviewing a growing number of crypto ETF applications. These include ETFs not only for Solana but also for assets such as XRP and Dogecoin. As more proposals advance to the review stage, industry analysts believe that approval of even a single fund could pave the way for broader acceptance of digital asset investment products.SEC Warms to Crypto Under New LeadershipThe growing number of ETF applications is unfolding alongside broader policy updates from the SEC. Earlier this week, the agency approved in-kind redemptions for both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. It also raised options limits for Bitcoin funds.Building on the regulatory momentum, SEC Chair Paul Atkins introduced a new initiative dubbed "" Project Crypto "" on Thursday. The initiative, aimed at overhauling the agency’s outdated digital asset framework, marks a significant policy shift. Most notably, Atkins stated that ""most crypto assets are not securities"", a reversal from previous SEC positions that could open the door to broader ETF approvals across the crypto market.This change in regulatory tone also reflects the Trump administration's more accommodating stance toward digital assets. Industry watchers believe such a climate could accelerate approvals for a wide range of crypto ETFs.Solana Price SnapshotAmid ETF-related developments, Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has shown mixed performance. As of press time, it was trading at $170.10, marking a 6% decrease over the past 24 hours and a 5% decrease over the past week. Despite short-term volatility, the token remains up 14.1% over the past month, trading within a broad range of $121 to $204.",Market|Latest Solana (SOL) News Today|Solana ETF,EN,1,several asset manager revised filing solana fund signaling forward movement toward potential approval security exchange commission week several leading financial firm including fidelity bitwise franklin templeton grayscale coinshares canary capital vaneck submitted revised proposal sec part renewed bid introduce spot solana updated registration statement reflect market observer interpret constructive engagement issuer sec post x nate geraci president novadius wealth noted amendment relatively minor however suggested reflect process aimed refining prospectus language meeting regulatory discloses fee structurefor context grayscale stated intends charge management fee solana fund payable fiat directly sol token approach aligns grayscale broader strategy offer potential differentiator increasingly crowded etf pipeline crypto etf proposalsbeyond adjustment sec reviewing growing number crypto etf application include etf solana also asset xrp dogecoin proposal advance review stage industry analyst believe approval even single fund could pave way broader acceptance digital asset investment warms crypto new leadershipthe growing number etf application unfolding alongside broader policy update sec earlier week agency approved redemption bitcoin ethereum spot etf also raised option limit bitcoin regulatory momentum sec chair paul atkins introduced new initiative dubbed project crypto thursday initiative aimed overhauling agency outdated digital asset framework mark significant policy shift notably atkins stated crypto asset security reversal previous sec position could open door broader etf approval across crypto change regulatory tone also reflects trump administration accommodating stance toward digital asset industry watcher believe climate could accelerate approval wide range crypto price snapshotamid development solana sol cryptocurrency market capitalization shown mixed performance press time trading marking decrease past hour decrease past week despite volatility token remains past month trading within broad range,0.0,0.809,0.191,0.9934,1

First presale participants can secure tokens at prices up to 50% lower than subsequent phase participants. Commons Foundation Chairman Choi Yong-kwan stated, “The first presale allocation is limited to 8 billion SATOSHI, and considering the pre-launch interest, we expect it to sell out quickly. We encourage interested investors to participate right at the launch time.” Simple Participation Process Participating in the $SATOSHI presale is straightforward. After sending USDT to the wallet address provided on the official website , participants install the WONPAY app, a dedicated MicroBitcoin wallet, to generate a wallet address. Subsequently, by emailing the transaction details (TXID) along with the wallet address, tokens are automatically distributed. Support for Tron (TRC-20), Solana, and BSC networks allows participants to freely choose their preferred network. Cryptocurrency Community Attention SatoshiMeme has drawn online engagement ahead of its presale, with social media discussions referencing its thematic alignment with Satoshi Nakamoto’s philosophy and the joint involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation. The hashtag #SatoshiMeme has been used in related conversations on Twitter. According to SatoshiMeme’s team, the participation of P2P Foundation has led to perceptions that distinguish SatoshiMeme from other meme coin initiatives, with some community members referring to SatoshiMeme as a ‘true successor’ to Satoshi and attributing ‘historical legitimacy’ to SatoshiMeme. These characterizations remain unverified and reflect the team’s interpretation of community sentiment. Presale Allocation and Market Outlook The first presale allocation is limited to 8 billion SATOSHI out of the total token supply, moving to the next phase immediately upon completion. According to the commons economic model, individuals or organizations contributing to the SatoshiMeme project will receive rewards through airdrops. According to SatoshiMeme’s team, SatoshiMeme has drawn attention due to the involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation, both of which have established backgrounds in blockchain-related initiatives. The team anticipates strong interest during the initial presale phase, citing broader market trends in which projects with distinctive themes and active communities have seen rapid presale completions SatoshiMeme is a token based on the MicroBitcoin (MBC) network, pursuing the realization of the micro-economic currency function originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. The project team has begun discussions with various major exchanges for listing and is preparing for exchange listings after presale completion.

2025-08-01 07:25:36,49348694,1754033136,Analysts eye $5K for Ethereum and 42x for this ETH-based altcoin,"This innovative DeFi project is leveraging Layer-2 efficiency and a unique lending model. As the crypto market evolves, both assets are capturing investor interest. Let’s explore their momentum. Ethereum’s steady climb toward $5,000 Ethereum is defying Bitcoin’s recent dip, maintaining strength near $4,000. Robust ETF inflows totaling $5.51 billion since July 3 are fueling this rally. Institutional buying is growing, with corporate treasuries holding nearly 2% of Ethereum’s supply. Analysts are citing a favorable regulatory shift, with the SEC softening its stance on staking. This could unlock new ETF features, boosting demand. Macroeconomic tailwinds, like steady Federal Reserve rates and AI-driven market sentiment are further supporting Ethereum’s ascent. A short squeeze is possible, potentially pushing prices past $5,000 soon. Consequently, Ethereum’s fundamentals are aligning for a significant breakout. Transitioning to emerging altcoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving its niche. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through Phase 6 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. This represents a 250% increase from the $0.01 starting price, offering early investors a 71% guaranteed ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, with only a limited supply remaining before a 14.3% price hike to $0.04 in Phase 7. Over $13,800,000 has been raised, with 660 million tokens sold to 14,700 holders. The project’s capped 4 billion token supply is driving demand. Furthermore, analysts are projecting a post-launch price of $1.50, suggesting a potential 42x return. This momentum is underpinned by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s robust utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a dual-lending ecosystem combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models on a Layer-2 network. This setup is reducing gas fees by up to 90%, enhancing accessibility. The peer-to-contract system is enabling stablecoin pooling with dynamic interest rates, offering up to 12% APY for assets like ETH and BTC. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer lending is catering to risk-tolerant investors, accepting memecoins like DOGE with up to 33% APY. An overcollateralized stablecoin system ensures price stability, minted only during loans and burned upon repayment. Moreover, a beta testnet is nearing launch, allowing users to test the platform’s functionality. Security and community engagement are further strengthening Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) security and rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, achieving a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities detected in its smart contracts. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program, partnered with CertiK, is rewarding researchers across four severity tiers. Additionally, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway is exciting the community, offering 10 winners $10,000 each for a $50 presale investment. Moreover, a leaderboard is rewarding the top 50 token holders with bonus tokens, encouraging long-term commitment. These initiatives are fostering trust and participation. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a reliable DeFi contender in the crypto market. Riding the DeFi wave As the crypto market anticipates Ethereum’s climb to $5,000, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-potential altcoin with a projected 42x gain. Its presale is nearing a critical juncture, with Phase 6 tokens at $0.035 offering a final low-price entry. The project’s Layer-2 efficiency, innovative lending, and strong security are driving investor confidence. Crypto predictions highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a standout, with its $1.50 post-launch target signaling substantial returns. Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in are encouraged to explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before the next price increase. Join the presale and be part of this DeFi evolution.

2025-08-01 07:25:11,49347912,1754033111,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Plunge Below $115,000 Sparks Concerns","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Plunge Below $115,000 Sparks Concerns The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, often characterized by swift movements. Recently, a significant event has captured the attention of investors worldwide: a notable Bitcoin price drop . According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency, BTC, has dipped below the critical $115,000 mark, currently trading at approximately $114,970.31 on the Binance USDT market. This development prompts a closer look at the factors at play and what it could mean for the broader crypto ecosystem. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces driving a Bitcoin price drop requires examining various market indicators and macroeconomic factors. Cryptocurrency markets are highly sensitive, and several elements can contribute to sudden shifts in valuation. Here are some common contributors: Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, or interest rate hikes by central banks can lead investors to de-risk, moving away from volatile assets like Bitcoin. This often correlates with a broader flight to safety, impacting risk assets globally. Regulatory Developments: News or rumors of stricter cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can create investor apprehension, leading to sell-offs. Uncertainty around new laws or enforcement actions can trigger a swift reaction across the market, contributing to a significant Bitcoin price drop . Whale Movements: Large transactions by significant holders (often termed ‘whales’) can influence market supply and demand, potentially triggering a Bitcoin price drop if substantial amounts are sold. Monitoring on-chain data for large movements can sometimes provide early indicators. Market Sentiment and Technical Indicators: A shift in overall market sentiment, perhaps fueled by negative news or a breach of key technical support levels, can accelerate downward trends. When Bitcoin breaks through established support, it often signals further downside potential, prompting algorithmic trading and retail investor reactions. The $115,000 level may have been a crucial psychological and technical support that, once breached, led to further selling pressure. Liquidation Events: In highly leveraged markets, a downward price movement can trigger liquidations of long positions, creating a cascade effect that further pushes prices down. This phenomenon can exacerbate a natural Bitcoin price drop , leading to rapid declines. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? A substantial Bitcoin price drop can evoke a range of reactions from investors, depending on their investment horizon and risk tolerance. For some, it presents a challenge, while for others, it might be an opportunity. Let’s explore the implications: Short-Term Traders: For those engaged in short-term trading, a rapid decline like this can lead to significant losses if positions are not managed effectively. Stop-loss orders are crucial for mitigating risk in such volatile conditions, helping to protect capital during a sharp Bitcoin price drop . Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Many long-term investors view such dips as temporary fluctuations within Bitcoin’s broader growth trajectory. They might see it as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower price, adhering to the ‘buy the dip’ strategy, believing in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite the current Bitcoin price drop . Liquidation Risks: Investors using leverage on exchanges face the risk of their positions being liquidated if the price falls below their margin requirements. This can be a painful consequence of a sudden Bitcoin price drop , especially for those with high leverage. Market Sentiment: Persistent downward pressure can erode overall market confidence, potentially leading to a broader sell-off across altcoins as well, given Bitcoin’s dominant position. A significant Bitcoin price drop often signals a ‘risk-off’ environment for the entire crypto market. To illustrate the typical price movements and potential impact, consider the following simplified market scenario: Market Event Potential Investor Reaction Short-Term Impact Long-Term Outlook Significant Bitcoin Price Drop Panic selling, forced liquidations, ‘buy the dip’ strategies Increased volatility, potential for further declines Opportunity for accumulation, potential for recovery and growth Negative Macro News Risk-off sentiment, shift to safer assets Broader market correction, correlation with traditional markets Temporary setback, underlying fundamentals may remain strong Learn more about market analysis tools that can help you understand price movements. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies After a Bitcoin Price Drop While a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, it is also a reminder of the importance of sound investment principles. How can investors navigate these turbulent waters? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information from multiple reputable sources. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on social media hype or fear. Focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and adoption trends, especially during a period of Bitcoin price drop . Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy helps average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term volatility and making a Bitcoin price drop less impactful on your overall average. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, not just cryptocurrencies. For traders, utilize stop-loss orders to limit potential downside and protect against unexpected movements during a Bitcoin price drop . Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic news, regulatory updates, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Understanding the broader context can help in making informed decisions during a Bitcoin price drop . Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience and recovery after significant dips. While past performance is not indicative of future results, a long-term outlook can help weather short-term storms and focus on Bitcoin’s potential growth despite a temporary Bitcoin price drop . Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any asset class, including cryptocurrencies. The key is to react thoughtfully rather than emotionally. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While such movements can be alarming, they are also integral to the market’s cycles. Understanding the underlying causes, assessing the impact on various investor profiles, and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount. For many, this dip might represent a strategic accumulation opportunity, reinforcing the importance of a long-term vision in the dynamic world of digital assets. Staying informed, exercising patience, and adhering to a well-thought-out investment plan are the best ways to navigate these challenging yet potentially rewarding periods. Frequently Asked Questions Q1: What does a Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 signify? A: It signifies a significant downward price movement, potentially driven by market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, or large sell-offs. For many, it indicates a breach of a psychological or technical support level, prompting further scrutiny of market conditions and highlighting the current Bitcoin price drop . Q2: Is this Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? A: For long-term investors, a significant Bitcoin price drop can be seen as an opportunity to buy at a lower price, often referred to as ‘buying the dip’. However, this depends on individual risk tolerance and investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? A: The duration of a Bitcoin price drop can vary widely, from a few days to several months, depending on the underlying causes and broader market conditions. There is no fixed timeline, and historical performance does not guarantee future results. Q4: What should I do if my crypto portfolio is down due to this Bitcoin price drop? A: It is important to avoid panic selling. Revisit your original investment thesis, assess your risk exposure, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging. If you are over-leveraged, managing your positions promptly is critical. Staying informed and consulting with a financial advisor, if needed, can also be beneficial during a Bitcoin price drop . Q5: Are there specific indicators to watch during a Bitcoin price drop? A: Yes, key indicators include trading volume (to gauge selling pressure), funding rates (for derivatives markets), on-chain metrics (like exchange inflows/outflows), and macroeconomic news (e.g., inflation data, interest rate announcements). Monitoring these can provide insights into market dynamics during a Bitcoin price drop . Did this article help you understand the recent Bitcoin price drop and its implications?

2025-08-01 07:21:19,49348693,1754032879,Investors pile into $0.035 coin as BNB and DOGE stall,"BNB and DOGE hold flat Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have been trading sideways, with BNB at ~$832 and DOGE at ~$0.24, showing minimal movement despite recent market volatility. BNB’s consolidation follows a 1.6 million token burn and Maxwell upgrade, which boosted active wallets by 37%, yet trading volume dipped 10% to $2.9 billion, reflecting investor caution. Technical indicators, including a neutral RSI (~50) and weakening ADX, suggest BNB lacks a clear catalyst to break resistance at $900. DOGE, down 10.75% weekly, struggles below $0.26 resistance, despite a 5.98% surge in open interest to $4.38 billion, signaling futures market confidence. Profit-taking after a 40% rally and a declining MFI indicates fading momentum. Both coins face macroeconomic headwinds and altcoin market fragmentation, with potential ETF approvals for DOGE and TRON’s market cap overtake of ADA diverting attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): from idle holdings to active yield BNB and DOGE holders have watched their portfolios stay flat, but early adopters of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have already seen sharp upward movement. Since the launch, the token has surged 350% from its Phase 1 price of $0.01. An investor who exited DOGE in Phase 3 and entered at $0.02 is now sitting on a 75% gain, and that gain isn’t speculative. It’s backed by real usage metrics like protocol growth in lending, borrowing, and upcoming platform functionalities. One core innovation driving activity is Mutuum Finance’s decentralized stablecoin system. Unlike models that collapsed due to poor backing or unlimited minting, this stablecoin will be minted only when overcollateralized loans are issued. It will be burned once the loan is repaid. The issuance is strictly controlled by protocol-level interest rate adjustments and blue-chip asset collateral. This ensures that the stablecoin maintains a strong peg while keeping the supply limited and accountable. As borrowing and staking activity grow, so does stablecoin demand, and that directly translates to increased utility and velocity for the MUTM token. Upcoming demand is also set to increase with the launch of the beta version of the lending and borrowing platform. This rollout will onboard new users, introduce liquidity to various pools, and drive platform volume—all activities that will place upward price pressure on MUTM as usage expands. More users interacting with the protocol equals more mtTokens minted, more fees generated, and more incentives distributed, further increasing the need for MUTM. Lending, staking, and buybacks: a self-reinforcing system Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just offering a new stablecoin—it’s building an ecosystem designed to reward every participant. Lenders who deposit assets like ETH, USDT, or SOL receive mtTokens, which automatically grow in value as interest accrues over time. These tokens can also be staked in smart contracts to earn passive MUTM rewards, which are distributed from protocol profits via automatic buybacks. This creates a dual-reward mechanism: your principal grows via APY, and your yield is further enhanced through MUTM dividends. As this ecosystem scales, token demand increases while circulating supply drops through consistent buybacks. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) model, lenders earn based on how much of the pool is utilized. For instance, lending 1,000 USDT when pool utilization is 80% can earn an APY of around 12%. Borrowers can lock up blue-chip assets and borrow against them, say 2 ETH ($7,000) at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, allowing them to access $4,200 without selling their ETH. That kind of access will pull more borrowers onto the platform, and every new loan increases protocol utility, and in turn, demand for MUTM. The platform will also support a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending system for users looking to negotiate custom terms with higher-risk assets like memecoins. While more advanced, it opens up alternative channels for interest generation, expanding Mutuum’s appeal to more DeFi users. Presale acceleration and rotation-driven momentum With over 14,700 holders already participating and more than $13.7 million raised, Phase 6 is now live at a token price of $0.035. Only 7% of the 170 million tokens allocated to Phase 6 have been sold. Once this phase concludes, the price will rise to $0.040, marking an immediate 15% increase. With a capped total supply of 4 billion MUTM, entry at this stage offers a clear upside for those seeking strong pre-launch positioning. CertiK has already completed its audit of the project, with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Security Score of 78.00. A $50,000 bug bounty is currently running to maintain the protocol’s integrity. Meanwhile, the ongoing $100,000 giveaway —divided among ten winners—adds further excitement and reach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted 12,000+ Twitter followers, building a strong community foundation ahead of launch. For investors still holding stagnant coins like BNB or DOGE, this is a compelling moment to rotate into a project that’s not only growing but doing so with actual mechanics and capital efficiency. Between the protocol’s in-process dual-yield systems, stablecoin design, Layer-2 scalability, and the beta rollout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer not just another presale opportunity, but a working product ecosystem that’s driving token value with every new feature introduced. Now trading under $0.04, this token looks primed to keep climbing, without needing a meme or hype cycle to move.

2025-08-01 07:20:45,49348692,1754032845,Mutuum Finance aiming for $5: could it be the best play before Q1 2026?,"From interest-earning lending to overcollateralized borrowing, from a protocol-native stablecoin to automated buybacks and staking, every part of the ecosystem is being designed to generate constant demand for the MUTM token, not just now, but as each function rolls out in its roadmap. Real DeFi functionality, built for longevity The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending engine is being built to offer passive daily returns for lenders based on pool utilization. When demand for loans is high, lenders benefit from higher annual percentage yields (APY). This creates a natural incentive to deposit assets like USDT, DAI, or even wrapped ETH and BTC — all while remaining in control of funds thanks to non-custodial smart contracts. Borrowers, meanwhile, access capital through overcollateralized vaults, offering a safer borrowing model. By requiring borrowers to lock more value than they borrow, the platform ensures protocol-wide solvency and reduces systemic risk. Users don’t need to sell their blue-chip crypto assets — they can borrow stablecoins while maintaining upside exposure. Perhaps the most exciting mechanism is the upcoming protocol-native stablecoin, which only mints when a loan is issued and burns upon repayment. This means its supply is directly tied to platform activity. As lending and borrowing increase, stablecoin transactions rise, driving more demand across the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) system. Another unique driver of token demand will be the staking system and buyback engine. As protocol revenue grows, a portion of earnings will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the market and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This creates a direct buy-pressure loop that rewards MUTM holders while controlling available supply — the textbook setup for exponential price movements. To scale these services further, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deploy its protocol on a Layer-2 network, enabling faster transactions and significantly lower gas fees. This infrastructure shift is expected to bring in a new wave of cost-conscious users and make lending, borrowing, and staking more efficient and accessible to retail and institutional users alike. Why early buyers are targeting the $5 mark At the time of writing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, with more than $13.7 million already raised and over 14,700 holders onboarded. The next phase will see the token jump by 15%, reaching $0.040 — a steep climb toward its planned listing price of $0.06, which represents a 70% potential increase from current levels. However, many early-phase investors entered back in Phase 1 when MUTM was priced at just $0.01. That means even at this stage, they are already sitting on 3.5x gains — and with analysts eyeing the $5 level by 2026, that would mean a staggering 500x return from the earliest entries, and nearly 140x even from today’s price. Security remains a top priority, too. The codebase has undergone an extensive manual review and static analysis through a $50,000 bug bounty program in partnership with CertiK. Audit scores currently stand at Token Scan 95.00 and Skynet 78.00, offering confidence to investors concerned about smart contract risks. To further grow its community and fuel adoption, the team has launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign, where ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM. This initiative, combined with an active and growing social media base of over 12,000 Twitter followers, sets the stage for a viral launch, especially as the beta version of the protocol goes live just ahead of token release. As each layer of the platform activates — from stablecoin mechanics to staking and buybacks — the demand for MUTM is expected to accelerate rapidly. This isn’t just a project that will rely on hype; it’s one where value is generated with every transaction, every loan, and every stake. Final thoughts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t mimicking legacy DeFi — it’s rewriting the playbook with smarter tokenomics, active buyback mechanisms, and real financial services wrapped into a scalable architecture. With only 7% of Phase 6 tokens sold and a listing price around the corner, the window to enter at this stage is rapidly closing. As new features unlock and user adoption rises, each part of the ecosystem will fuel the next — a compounding effect that can push MUTM well beyond its presale valuations. With a clear roadmap and tight supply dynamics, the goal of $5 by early 2026 isn’t a moonshot — it’s a strategic trajectory built on fundamentals.

2025-08-01 07:15:10,49347488,1754032510,"Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin: Ambitious Plan to Acquire 2,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin: Ambitious Plan to Acquire 2,000 BTC In the evolving landscape of digital finance, a significant development is unfolding in Europe. French-listed fintech company, Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin (CBI), is making headlines with its strategic foray into the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This move signals a growing trend of traditional companies embracing digital assets, and CBI’s plans are particularly ambitious. For anyone keenly observing the intersection of traditional finance and the crypto revolution, CBI’s strategy offers a compelling case study. What is Driving Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin Strategy? Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin acquisition strategy is not just a casual dip into the crypto pool; it’s a calculated and growing commitment. According to insights shared by @btcNLNico on X, CBI has already accumulated 21.52 BTC over the last three months, bringing their current total holdings to 25.07 BTC. This initial accumulation serves as a foundation for a much larger vision. The company has also announced a pivotal strategic partnership with SAFEbit, a Turkish crypto platform, which paves the way for a truly remarkable future purchase target: up to 2,000 BTC. This phased approach to Bitcoin acquisition suggests a well-thought-out plan rather than impulsive buying. It allows CBI to gradually integrate Bitcoin into its balance sheet, potentially mitigating some of the immediate volatility risks while positioning itself for long-term growth in the digital asset space. How Does This Acquisition Compare to Others? CBI’s target of up to 2,000 BTC, while substantial for a company of its size and market position, can be put into perspective by looking at other notable institutional Bitcoin holders. While it may not reach the colossal holdings of a MicroStrategy or a Tesla, it certainly places CBI among a growing list of public companies diversifying into Bitcoin. This move by Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin is a clear indicator that the appetite for digital assets among publicly traded entities is expanding beyond the early adopters. Company Primary Industry Approximate BTC Holdings (Examples) Motivation for Holding BTC MicroStrategy Business Intelligence >200,000 BTC Primary Treasury Reserve Asset Tesla Automotive & Energy ~9,720 BTC (as of Q4 2023) Balance Sheet Diversification Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI) Fintech, Blockchain, Gaming 25.07 BTC (current), up to 2,000 BTC (future) Strategic Investment, Partnership Synergy What are the Potential Benefits for CBI and the Crypto Market? The decision by Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin to make such a substantial investment carries multiple potential benefits, both for the company itself and for the broader cryptocurrency market: Balance Sheet Enhancement: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value, akin to digital gold. Holding BTC can potentially hedge against inflation and provide a long-term appreciating asset on CBI’s balance sheet. Increased Investor Appeal: For investors looking for exposure to the crypto market through regulated entities, CBI’s Bitcoin holdings could make it a more attractive investment vehicle. It signals a forward-thinking and innovative approach. Strategic Partnerships and Synergies: The partnership with SAFEbit is crucial. It suggests CBI is not just buying Bitcoin, but also leveraging expertise and infrastructure from established crypto platforms. This could lead to further collaborations and product development within the crypto space. Market Validation: Each new company, especially a publicly listed one, that publicly announces Bitcoin acquisition plans adds another layer of legitimacy and validation to the asset class. This can encourage other hesitant traditional businesses to consider similar moves. Pioneering in Europe: As a French-listed company, CBI’s move could inspire other European firms to follow suit, fostering greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin across the continent. A cartoon illustration of a large hand representing Crypto Blockchain Industries, placing a Bitcoin coin into a digital piggy bank, symbolizing investment and growth. Are There Any Challenges or Risks Involved? While the prospects for Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin strategy appear promising, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for its significant fluctuations. Large holdings mean that CBI’s balance sheet could experience considerable swings in value, impacting its reported financials. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in Europe. Changes in regulations regarding taxation, custody, or usage could impact the value and utility of CBI’s Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss. CBI will need to ensure top-tier cold storage and security protocols are in place, especially given the partnership with a crypto platform. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, some traditional investors might still view Bitcoin as a speculative asset, potentially affecting CBI’s stock performance if not managed well. CBI’s experience as a fintech company, with its existing blockchain focus, likely provides it with a better understanding of these risks compared to companies without prior crypto exposure. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The actions of companies like Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin are critical bellwethers for the broader institutional adoption trend. Their willingness to commit significant capital to Bitcoin, despite market volatility, underscores a growing belief in its long-term value proposition. This is not just about a single company; it’s about a ripple effect that could see more corporations, especially in the fintech and tech sectors, follow suit. The partnership with SAFEbit also highlights an emerging model where traditional companies leverage the expertise and infrastructure of native crypto platforms for their digital asset strategies. This collaborative approach can accelerate adoption and streamline the complexities of managing crypto assets. A Compelling Future for Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin In conclusion, Crypto Blockchain Industries’ ambitious plan to acquire up to 2,000 BTC is a powerful statement. It solidifies their position as a forward-thinking fintech company actively participating in the digital economy. This strategic move, bolstered by a key partnership with SAFEbit, showcases a clear vision for integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategy.

Here's All the Data,"Bitcoin closed July at $115,768, marking its first monthly close at this level in its 16-year history. Although the world's largest cryptocurrency fell 2.34% in the last 24 hours, the close was a record. Bitcoin Hits All-Time Monthly Close at $115,768 “Bitcoin closing this month at an all-time high isn’t just a headline; it’s a testament to the market’s resilience and maturation,” said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. Lucas noted that despite the large 80,000 BTC transfer to Galaxy Digital in July and the subsequent sell-off, the price remained stable. While this sell-off caused a brief 4% drop in Bitcoin, the market quickly absorbed the impact. “This level of recovery shows that a strong buyer base has formed in the market that trusts Bitcoin,” Lucas said, emphasizing that Bitcoin remains resilient despite macroeconomic uncertainties during this period of increasing institutional interest. On the other hand, LVRG Research Director Nick Ruck stated that investors can realize profits, and this will depend on the policies of the US Federal Reserve (Fed), Trump's possible tariffs and ETF fund flows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced outflows in recent days, with the strong inflows of the first half of July seemingly giving way to weaker net flows. However, Ruck stated that the current decline is temporary and that he expects a recovery in August. Lucas emphasized that Bitcoin is in a strong position in the long term: “Bitcoin is increasingly adopted as a scarce, decentralized asset, and its role in the global financial system is strengthening.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-01 07:10:11,49347279,1754032211,Urgent Concerns: Trump Stablecoin Ties Spark Unprecedented Conflict of Interest Debate,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Concerns: Trump Stablecoin Ties Spark Unprecedented Conflict of Interest Debate In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where innovation often collides with regulation, a significant storm is brewing on Capitol Hill. The spotlight is now firmly on the potential conflicts of interest surrounding the Trump family’s ventures into the digital asset space, specifically concerning a particular Trump stablecoin . This isn’t just about financial transactions; it’s about the very integrity of financial policy and the trust placed in public officials. US Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden have raised alarm bells, directly appealing to Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould at the OCC to address what they describe as an “unprecedented conflict of interest.” Their concerns are rooted in the Trump family’s financial stake in the stablecoin USD1, fearing it could allow President Trump to unduly influence federal crypto policy for personal gain. This situation highlights a critical juncture for cryptocurrency regulation and ethical governance. What Are the Core Concerns About Trump Stablecoin Ties? The core of the senators’ apprehension stems from the potential for a sitting or former President to leverage their position for personal financial benefit through digital assets. The letter sent to the OCC outlines several key concerns: Direct Financial Interest: The Trump family’s reported financial stake in the stablecoin USD1 is at the heart of the matter. This direct tie raises questions about whether future policy decisions regarding stablecoins or the broader crypto market could be swayed to benefit personal investments. “Unprecedented Conflict of Interest”: The lawmakers explicitly labeled the situation as unparalleled, emphasizing that such a direct financial link between a presidential family and a specific financial product could undermine public trust in regulatory processes. Threat to Financial Stability: Beyond ethics, the senators warned that this scenario poses a threat to the nation’s financial stability. If stablecoin policy is perceived as influenced by personal gain rather than sound economic principles, it could lead to market instability or erode confidence in the US financial system. Call for OCC Action: The letter urges the OCC to provide a clear explanation of how it plans to address these potential conflicts. The agency’s role in overseeing financial institutions and ensuring market integrity makes its response crucial. The situation surrounding the Trump stablecoin needs transparent handling. The implications of these concerns extend beyond just the Trump family. They touch upon the broader challenge of regulating a rapidly evolving financial landscape where traditional ethics frameworks may not fully apply to digital assets and the potential for new forms of influence. Why Do Stablecoins Matter in This Debate? Stablecoins are a unique class of cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their value to a stable asset, such as the US dollar. They serve as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto market, facilitating trading, lending, and payments. The specific stablecoin mentioned, USD1, reportedly has ties to the Trump family, making its regulatory status and future particularly sensitive. Here’s why stablecoins are central to this discussion: Bridge to Traditional Finance: Stablecoins are often seen as the gateway for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Their stability makes them attractive for everyday transactions and institutional use, increasing their systemic importance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Due to their potential to grow into significant payment systems, stablecoins have been under intense scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Discussions around reserve requirements, consumer protection, and financial stability are ongoing. Potential for Influence: If a prominent political family has a vested interest in a specific stablecoin, it raises legitimate questions about whether their influence could be used to shape favorable regulatory outcomes, potentially disadvantaging competitors or the broader market. This is a key aspect of the Trump stablecoin debate. The integrity of stablecoin regulation is paramount for the health of the crypto ecosystem and the broader financial system. Any perception of undue influence could severely damage confidence. Navigating the Challenges: Potential Conflicts and Financial Stability The challenges presented by the alleged Trump stablecoin ties are multi-faceted, encompassing ethical, regulatory, and systemic risks. Understanding these complexities is vital for both policymakers and the public. Aspect Typical Stablecoin Regulation Goal Concerns with Trump Stablecoin Ties Primary Goal Ensuring consumer protection, fostering financial stability, maintaining market integrity. Risk of policy decisions being influenced by personal financial gain, not public interest. Oversight Bodies’ Role Independent assessment and enforcement by OCC, Federal Reserve, SEC, Treasury. OCC is specifically pressed to address potential conflicts, raising questions about independence. Key Risk Factors De-pegging events, liquidity crises, use in illicit finance, lack of transparency. “Unprecedented conflict of interest” creating systemic risk and eroding public trust. The fear is that if a president or their family has a significant financial interest in a specific stablecoin, they might be incentivized to push for regulations that benefit that particular asset, potentially at the expense of fair competition or broader market health. This could lead to a lack of confidence in the regulatory environment, deterring legitimate innovation and investment in the US crypto space. Moreover, it could set a dangerous precedent for future administrations. Actionable Insights: What’s Next for Stablecoin Regulation? The letter from Senators Warren, Van Hollen, and Wyden is not merely a complaint; it’s a call to action that could shape the future of stablecoin regulation and ethical oversight in the digital age. Here are some potential next steps and implications: Increased Scrutiny on Political Ties: Expect greater focus on the financial holdings of political figures and their families, especially concerning emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies. This could lead to more stringent disclosure requirements. OCC’s Response: The Comptroller of the Currency, Jonathan Gould, is now under pressure to provide a robust and transparent response. His actions will be closely watched by lawmakers, industry participants, and the public. A failure to adequately address these concerns could lead to further legislative action. Broader Regulatory Framework: This incident could accelerate discussions around a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins, ensuring they are regulated similarly to traditional financial instruments, with strong provisions against conflicts of interest. The goal is to prevent any future Trump stablecoin type situations from undermining trust. Public Awareness: The debate brings crucial attention to the intersection of politics, finance, and technology. It educates the public about the importance of ethical governance in the digital asset space and the potential for new forms of influence. Ultimately, this situation underscores the need for clear, consistent, and ethically sound regulatory principles that can adapt to the rapid evolution of financial technology while upholding public trust. In Summary: The concerns raised by Democratic senators regarding the Trump family’s stablecoin ties represent a critical moment for US cryptocurrency policy. What began as a venture into digital assets has escalated into a serious debate about potential conflicts of interest, financial stability, and the integrity of regulatory oversight. The focus on the USD1 stablecoin and the call for the OCC to address these issues highlight the growing importance of ethical governance in the rapidly expanding crypto market. As the industry matures, ensuring transparency and preventing undue influence will be paramount to fostering trust and enabling responsible innovation. This ongoing saga serves as a powerful reminder that as digital assets become more integrated into the global financial system, so too must the frameworks that govern them evolve to uphold the highest standards of accountability and public interest. The resolution of this Trump stablecoin controversy will undoubtedly set precedents for future political involvement in the crypto sphere. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin, and why are they relevant to this issue? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar, reducing volatility. They are relevant because the Trump family’s alleged financial stake in the USD1 stablecoin raises concerns about potential policy influence. Which senators raised concerns about the Trump family’s stablecoin ties? US Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden sent a letter to the OCC expressing their concerns. What specific stablecoin is mentioned in the controversy? The stablecoin at the center of the controversy is USD1, which reportedly has financial ties to the Trump family. What is the OCC’s role in addressing these concerns? The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is being pressed by the senators to explain how it will address the potential conflicts of interest and ensure the integrity of federal crypto policy. Why is this situation considered an “unprecedented conflict of interest”? Lawmakers describe it as “unprecedented” due to the direct financial stake of a presidential family in a specific financial product, raising fears of personal gain influencing federal policy and threatening financial stability.

2025-08-01 07:09:14,49347278,1754032154,"Coinbase Sees Q2 Retail Trading Decline, But XRP Outperforms Ethereum in Consumer Revenue","Coinbase reported a sharp drop in retail trading volumes for Q2, with total transaction revenue falling 39% quarter-over-quarter to $764 million. Key Takeaways: XRP outperformed Ethereum in Coinbase’s Q2 consumer revenue, holding a 13% share. Retail interest in XRP surged after legal clarity, with Q1 trading share peaking at 18%. XRP notional open interest hit a record $8.8B, signaling growing bullish sentiment. However, XRP emerged as a standout, generating more consumer transaction revenue than Ethereum for the second consecutive quarter. According to the company’s Q2 shareholder letter , XRP accounted for 13% of Coinbase’s consumer transaction revenue, edging out Ethereum at 12%. XRP Retail Trading Surged to 18% in Q1 After Legal Clarity This builds on Q1 figures, where XRP’s share jumped from 10% to a temporary peak of 18%, fueled by renewed retail interest following legal clarity around the asset. Ethereum, despite delivering a stronger overall return in Q2 — 38% compared to XRP’s 11% — trailed in consumer revenue. Analysts point to a growing disconnect between retail trading activity and broader institutional flows. Ethereum’s momentum was largely attributed to developments around its ecosystem and growing anticipation for spot ETF approvals. XRP’s steady rise in trading share from below 10% earlier in 2024 underscores the impact of regulatory clarity on retail behavior. XRP holders are the most valuable in the whole of crypto. $XRP accounted for a higher percentage of Coinbase trading revenue than $ETH or $SOL . (Source: Coinbase Q2 2025 earnings) pic.twitter.com/6VQc1FwWgi — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) August 1, 2025 XRP saw a spike in notional open interest for its perpetual futures contracts last month. Notional open interest, the total value of leveraged positions held by traders, climbed to an all-time high of $8.8 billion , according to CoinGlass. The figure corresponds to nearly 2.9 billion XRP in open contracts. The previous record for XRP notional open interest stood at $8.3 billion, which was hit in late January before the start of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Across most venues, XRP’s funding rate was positive and climbing, signaling a market where longs are willing to pay shorts to maintain positions, a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. As reported, the number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP tokens has also surged to an all-time high . Coinbase Named TIME ‘Disruptor’ As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. The accolade highlights Coinbase’s aggressive advocacy in Washington and its expanding influence in the crypto sector. Coinbase’s stock has surged 42% year-to-date, climbing from around $303 to a high near $382. The rise comes amid the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and Coinbase’s historic inclusion in the S&P 500 in May . TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator. Additionally, Coinbase is seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized equities, which would position it as a competitor to popular retail trading platforms like Robinhood and WeBull.

2025-08-01 07:05:44,49347961,1754031944,"Best crypto of the season? This presale token gains 20%, eyes 15% price spike","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an ecosystem centered around lending, borrowing, passive income, and a stablecoin that is only minted against real crypto collateral. That structure alone puts it ahead of many tokens offering no clear use. Now, with price momentum growing and a 15% increase locked in for the next presale phase, the window to buy MUTM before it gets significantly more expensive is narrowing fast. mtTokens, stablecoin utility, and a revenue-backed ecosystem At the center of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s future growth is its innovative dual-token architecture. Once the platform goes live, depositors of stablecoins and top-notch coins will receive mtTokens in 1:1 interest-bearing tokens that automatically grow in value as lending demand increases. These tokens are designed to deliver passive income without the need for lockups, auto-compounding strategies, or complex manual management. On the other side, the protocol is preparing to introduce a decentralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. What sets it apart is its supply mechanism: new stablecoins will only be minted when loans are issued and will be burned automatically as loans are repaid. This controlled, on-demand issuance model reduces the inflationary risks and de-pegging vulnerabilities seen in other stablecoin systems. Protocol-set interest rates will help regulate demand and sustain the peg over time. Another powerful driver of MUTM’s utility will be its staking ecosystem. Users who stake mtTokens in smart contracts will earn MUTM rewards funded by real protocol revenue. Rather than inflating the token supply, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to execute ongoing buybacks from the open market, then redistribute those MUTM tokens directly to mtToken stakers. This mechanism simultaneously handles the circulating supply and reinforces upward price pressure. The recent 20% uptick in MUTM’s price isn’t a hype-driven anomaly—it reflects growing presale momentum and the expectation of real utility. As each piece of the ecosystem nears launch, more users are entering early, positioning themselves ahead of the next price tier. Phase 6 price still at $0.035, but not for long The presale is now in Phase 6, with MUTM priced at $0.035. Over 14,700 holders have already joined the ecosystem, and 7% of the 170 million tokens allocated to this phase have been sold. Once this round completes, the price will automatically increase to $0.040—a 15% spike that makes the current entry point a strategic bargain for investors looking to lock in before it gets more expensive. One investor swapped out of Bitcoin (BTC) during Phase 2, getting in at just $0.015. Today, that position is up by 133%, and with the launch of staking contracts, beta access, and the stablecoin system on the horizon, returns are set to scale further. This presale isn’t just a funding round—it’s a front-row seat to a DeFi system that prioritizes utility and protocol growth. And this growth is visible in every part of the platform. In the P2C lending model, users supplying stablecoins like USDT or blue-chip tokens like ETH are already earning double-digit APYs (based on pool utilization). For example, a lender providing $10,000 worth of USDT into a high-demand pool earning 14.2% APY will generate $1,420 per year in passive income, automatically compounding through the mtToken structure. On the borrowing side, a user locking $15,000 worth of SOL as collateral with a 70% LTV can immediately borrow $10,500 in stablecoins, with rates dynamically adjusted based on pool usage and collateral type. These are practical, working DeFi mechanisms—not hypothetical promises. The platform also supports P2P lending, where users can set terms directly and trade risk for yield. While P2P models suit more aggressive investors, the infrastructure gives both risk-averse and high-risk traders tools that most projects don’t even plan for. CertiK audit, $100K giveaway, and limited time before listing price hits $0.06 Security is a non-negotiable for serious DeFi investors, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already passed a rigorous CertiK audit. With a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and Skynet rating of 78.00, the protocol is not only functional—it’s battle-tested. A $50,000 bug bounty program is live, inviting developers to probe the system before full launch. And to sweeten the presale, a $100,000 giveaway is underway. Ten lucky winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, just for participating during the current phase. With the listing price confirmed at $0.06, entering at $0.035 today means investors are buying in at a 70% discount to the initial exchange price. That’s a difference only early movers will enjoy—because once the next phase kicks in and then listing goes live, this opportunity will be gone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is checking every box: smart tokenomics, working DeFi products in process, deep incentives, and sustainable yield. The breakout has already started—those waiting will just end up paying more.

In a new analysis, Ashok Varadhan, Goldman’s co-head of global banking and markets, says that gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be an effective hedge against currency devaluation amid a ballooning national budget deficit. “Many investors have become more bearish on the US dollar amid fiscal concerns, and Goldman Sachs Research expects further depreciation in the currency. But Varadhan points out that the US isn’t the only developed market with an unusually large budget deficit. The US budget deficit this year is estimated to be about 6% of GDP, while the deficit of France is 5.5%, and the UK 3.6%, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Varadhan suggests that assets like gold and Bitcoin could climb relative to fiat currencies.” Varadhan also says that stocks may continue in an uptrend because President Trump’s reduction in government regulations may help stimulate the economy and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) may help companies generate larger profits. “Varadhan says he’s ‘super bullish’ on equities, even though they’ve reached all-time highs. There’s a tailwind to the US economy from deregulation, and it will be crucial to assess whether the US manages a fair recalibration of trade and continues to attract the best, brightest, and most able people to its labor market… We’re not even in the first inning of companies implementing AI.

2025-08-01 07:00:53,49346910,1754031653,Coinbase Stock Dips On Q2 Revenue Miss And Decreased Trading Volumes,"Coinbase (COIN) shares experienced a decline on Thursday after the cryptocurrency exchange reported second-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts’ expectations, according to CNBC. Weaker Trading Volumes Impact Coinbase For the period ending June 30, Coinbase reported a net income of $1.43 billion, or $5.14 per share, a significant rise from just $36.13 million, or 14 cents per share, in the same quarter the previous year. This growth was largely driven by a $1.5 billion gain from its investment in Circle (CRCL) and an additional $362 million from its crypto investment portfolio. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.96 per share, surpassing estimates of $1.26, according to LSEG. Related Reading: JPMorgan, Coinbase Forge Historic Pact For Direct Bank-Crypto Wallet Integration By 2026 However, total revenue slightly increased to $1.5 billion, up from $1.45 billion a year ago, yet it still fell short of the anticipated $1.6 billion. Transaction-related revenue totaled $764 million, which missed StreetAccount’s estimates of $787 million. As a result, shares fell 6% in after-hours trading. Analysts had predicted a weaker second quarter following a period of market enthusiasm in the first quarter, when traders were optimistic about potential regulatory improvements from the Trump administration. As attention in Washington shifted towards tariffs, speculative trading by retail investors declined across centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs). Nonetheless, inflows into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and purchases by treasury companies helped sustain market prices. Short Of Analyst Expectations Coinbase did report a 16% year-over-year growth in retail trading volume, reaching $43 billion. However, this was below the $48.05 billion expected by analysts. The company’s subscription and service offerings, which encompass stablecoins, staking, interest income, and custody services, experienced a 9% increase from the previous year, totaling $655.8 million. This figure was also below analysts’ projections of $705.9 million. Revenue from stablecoins, a key theme in the crypto market during the second quarter, came in at $332.5 million, closely aligning with estimates of $333.2 million. This represented a substantial 38% increase compared to the same period last year and a 12% rise from the first quarter.

Coinbase benefits from a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, allowing it to retain 100% of the revenue generated from USDC held on its platform and approximately 50% of revenue from USDC on other platforms. Despite the challenges in trading volumes, the company announced plans to broaden its services beyond cryptocurrencies, introducing tokenized real-world assets, derivatives, prediction markets, and early-stage token sales, starting with US users. Year-to-date, Coinbase shares remain up more than 50%, outperforming the S&P 500 benchmark, which the stock joined in May. As of this writing, COIN closed the trading day at $377.

Experts are also weighing in on what may happen next, and Levi Rietveld, a well-followed analyst on X, has consulted Grok, Elon Musk’s AI, for insight. Rietveld shared a striking interpretation of Grok’s projections related to the ongoing bull run, particularly in connection with macroeconomic moves from the U.S. Federal Reserve. According to Rietveld, if the Fed begins lowering interest rates in September 2025 and maintains that trajectory into Q1 2026, markets could be looking at a delayed but more pronounced cycle peak. Grok estimates that this could push the top of the current bull run into a three-month window, between January 1 and March 31, 2026. Grok Signals #XRP Rally! pic.twitter.com/7HytVTcOyd — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 29, 2025 Fed Policy and Market Timing The timing of the next interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve has become a central question for financial markets. The community has been anticipating these rate cuts for a long time, and according to Rietveld, Grok’s forecast reflects a scenario in which monetary easing triggers continued expansion of market liquidity, extending the current cycle rather than ending it abruptly. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has refused to lower interest rates despite political pressures. The projected window for a peak in early 2026 is directly tied to the assumption that the Fed follows through with rate cuts beginning in September and maintains that course into the new year. Rietveld noted that this would represent a shift from earlier expectations that the cycle might end sometime in 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Global Conditions and Market Dependence While the Fed’s actions are central to the outlook, Rietveld also pointed to uncertainty around quantitative easing efforts in other major economies. He believes it’s becoming increasingly unlikely that China or Europe will continue to ease, making the U.S. the primary driver of liquidity in global markets through the rest of the cycle. In this context, XRP’s performance could be susceptible to U.S. policy decisions . With other major economies possibly holding steady or tightening, the U.S. money supply and interest rate direction will likely have a significant impact on capital flows into digital assets, affecting XRP’s trajectory leading into 2026 and potentially helping it reach a new peak in Q1 2026.

Analysts highlight $0.110 target as TD Sequential signals buy and longs face liquidations. Market cap milestones: $0.19 for $10B and $1.10 aligning with Dogecoin’s peak. Bullish Flag Formation Pudgy Penguins’ token, PENGU, is trading near $0.034, with a 24-hour decline of 12% and a weekly decline of 9%. Trading volume stands at $1.13 billion. On the 4-hour chart, the asset has formed a bullish pennant, which consists of a sharp upward move, known as a flagpole, followed by consolidation inside converging trendlines. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that PENGU shows a textbook bullish flag. The flagpole was formed during the price move to $0.045 in July. Notably, the current range is between the upper resistance near $0.04–$0.045 and support near $0.035, which matches the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement. Other key Fibonacci levels are $0.029 (0.618), $0.026 (0.5), and $0.022 (0.382). $PENGU is forming a textbook bullish flag, signaling a potential explosive bullish breakout toward $0.110! pic.twitter.com/XcugaQEZFW — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Market Capitalization Levels and Price Range K A L E O mentioned that PENGU is trading under its previous all-time high of $0.068. The token experienced a long decline into early 2025 before breaking two descending trendlines and entering its current range. The next market cap levels are $0.19 for a $10 billion valuation and $1.10–$1.50, matching Dogecoin’s last cycle peak near $100 billion. These levels serve as the next price zones if the token continues to advance beyond the current resistance. PENGU Signals Breakout as Longs Suffer Martinez also reported that the TD Sequential indicator has issued a buy signal. The setup shows the trendline holding as support, a bullish divergence on the RSI, and price moving along the lower edge of its channel. Consequently, these technical conditions align with the bullish flag structure, which projects a potential target of $0.110 if an upward breakout occurs. Furthermore, Analyst Sjuul, Founder of AltCryptoGems, notes that the token faces resistance at the current zone. Previous breakouts, such as the one near $0.017, also faced initial rejection before advancing further. The analyst also advises market participants to consider focusing on buying the dip opportunities at this stage. Data from Coinalyze shows $4.0 million in liquidations over the last 24 hours.

2025-08-01 06:55:10,49346642,1754031310,Japan Yen Volatility: Unsettling Slide Prompts Official Alarm,"BitcoinWorld Japan Yen Volatility: Unsettling Slide Prompts Official Alarm For those navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the broader macro landscape is crucial. The recent alarming Japan Yen volatility serves as a stark reminder of how traditional financial markets can influence global capital flows and investor sentiment. While digital assets offer a decentralized alternative, they are not entirely immune to the ripples caused by significant shifts in major fiat currencies. The yen’s slide to a four-month low has caught the attention of finance ministers globally, signaling potential shifts that could impact everything from trade balances to investment strategies, including those in the crypto space. What’s Driving This Alarming Japan Yen Volatility? Japan’s currency, the yen, has been on a noticeable downward trajectory, reaching its lowest point against the US dollar in four months. This significant Japan Yen volatility has prompted direct expressions of concern from top Japanese officials, including Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki. But what exactly is fueling this decline? Several interconnected factors are at play, creating a complex economic environment. Interest Rate Divergence: Perhaps the most significant driver is the stark difference in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and other major central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve. While the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation, the BOJ has largely maintained its ultra-loose monetary policy, keeping rates near zero or even negative. This creates a yield differential, making yen-denominated assets less attractive to investors seeking higher returns, thus encouraging capital outflow and yen selling. Global Economic Slowdown Concerns: Lingering worries about a global economic slowdown can also influence currency movements. If investors perceive a weaker global growth outlook, they might shift away from currencies associated with export-dependent economies like Japan, further exacerbating the yen’s weakness. Energy and Commodity Prices: Japan is a major importer of energy and raw materials. Rising global commodity prices mean Japan needs to spend more yen to purchase these essential imports, increasing demand for foreign currency and putting downward pressure on the yen. Safe-Haven Status Erosion: Historically, the yen has been considered a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty. However, the persistent low-interest-rate environment and concerns over Japan’s long-term economic prospects have somewhat eroded this status, leading to less demand for the yen during risk-off periods. How Does a Weaker Yen Impact the Japanese Economy? The Yen depreciation impact is a double-edged sword for the Japanese economy, presenting both advantages and significant challenges. While a weaker currency can provide a boost in certain sectors, it also creates considerable headwinds for others, particularly for the average consumer. Here’s a breakdown of the key impacts: Benefits for Exporters: Japanese companies that export goods and services, such as automobile manufacturers (Toyota, Honda) and electronics giants (Sony, Panasonic), benefit significantly. Their products become cheaper and more competitive in international markets when priced in foreign currencies. This translates to higher yen-denominated profits when foreign earnings are repatriated, potentially boosting corporate earnings and stock prices. Boost to Tourism: A weaker yen makes Japan a more affordable and attractive destination for foreign tourists. This can lead to increased visitor numbers, boosting revenue for hotels, restaurants, retail, and other tourism-related industries, providing a much-needed stimulus to local economies. Challenges for Importers and Consumers: Conversely, the Yen depreciation impact is keenly felt by importers. Japan relies heavily on imports for energy, food, and many raw materials. A weaker yen means these essential goods become more expensive when purchased in foreign currency, leading to higher import costs. These increased costs are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday goods, contributing to inflationary pressures and eroding purchasing power. Inflationary Pressures: While the Bank of Japan has struggled to achieve its 2% inflation target for years, a rapidly depreciating yen can push inflation higher, not necessarily due to robust domestic demand but due to imported inflation. This ‘bad inflation’ can squeeze household budgets and reduce real wages. Impact Summary: Aspect Positive Impact of Weak Yen Negative Impact of Weak Yen Exports More competitive, higher profits N/A Imports N/A Higher costs for energy, food, raw materials Tourism Increased visitors, boosted revenue N/A Consumers N/A Higher prices, reduced purchasing power Inflation Helps reach BOJ target (if controlled) Imported inflation, ‘bad inflation’ What Does the Japanese Economy Outlook Suggest for the Future? The current state of the Japanese economy outlook is a complex picture, balancing signs of recovery with persistent challenges. While GDP growth has shown some resilience and corporate profits have improved, the long-standing issues of deflationary pressures, an aging population, and a massive public debt remain significant hurdles. Inflation Targets and Wage Growth: The Bank of Japan’s primary goal is to achieve stable 2% inflation, accompanied by sustainable wage growth. The weaker yen is helping push headline inflation higher, but the crucial question is whether this translates into broad-based wage increases that can support domestic consumption and break Japan’s deflationary mindset. Without significant wage hikes, the current inflation could be detrimental to households. Monetary Policy Stance: The BOJ has been an outlier among major central banks, maintaining ultra-loose monetary policy. While they have made minor adjustments, such as widening the yield curve control (YCC) band, a full pivot to rate hikes is seen as a major step. The Japanese economy outlook heavily depends on the BOJ’s cautious approach, balancing the need to support economic recovery with the risks of a weakening yen. Government Debt: Japan has the highest public debt-to-GDP ratio among developed nations. While largely held domestically, the cost of servicing this debt could rise if interest rates eventually increase significantly, adding another layer of complexity to the economic outlook. Structural Reforms: Beyond monetary policy, the long-term health of the Japanese economy relies on successful structural reforms to boost productivity, encourage innovation, and address demographic challenges. These reforms are crucial for sustainable growth independent of currency fluctuations. How Are Current Currency Market Trends Impacting Global Finance? The yen’s weakness is not an isolated event; it’s a significant development within broader currency market trends that have global ramifications. When a major currency like the yen experiences such pronounced volatility, it sends ripples across international financial systems, influencing trade, investment flows, and even the strategies of central banks worldwide. Impact on Other Asian Currencies: A significantly weaker yen can put pressure on other Asian currencies to depreciate as well, especially those of export-oriented economies that compete with Japan. Countries like South Korea and China might find their exports relatively more expensive, potentially leading to competitive devaluations or increased trade tensions. Carry Trade Resurgence: The low-interest-rate environment in Japan makes the yen an attractive funding currency for ‘carry trades.’ Investors borrow yen at low rates and then invest in higher-yielding assets in other currencies. The current currency market trends , characterized by yen weakness, can encourage a resurgence of this trade, further contributing to the yen’s depreciation and potentially creating volatility in other markets. Global Trade Dynamics: For countries that trade extensively with Japan, the yen’s depreciation affects the cost of imports and exports. While Japanese exports become cheaper, imports from Japan become more expensive for foreign buyers. This can shift trade balances and impact supply chains, especially for industries deeply integrated with Japanese manufacturing. Central Bank Watch: Other central banks are closely monitoring the yen’s movements. Significant currency volatility in a major economy can spill over, affecting inflation expectations, capital flows, and the effectiveness of their own monetary policies. This interconnectedness means that Japan’s currency woes are not just a domestic issue but a global concern within the intricate web of currency market trends . Will Japan Resort to Forex Intervention to Stabilize the Yen? The alarm expressed by Japanese officials, particularly Finance Minister Suzuki, raises the crucial question: will Japan step in with direct Forex intervention Japan to prop up the yen? Japan has a history of intervening in currency markets, especially when the yen weakens rapidly or becomes excessively strong, and the current situation is certainly testing the government’s patience. Past Interventions: Japan last intervened to support the yen in 2022, spending billions of dollars to buy yen and sell dollars. These interventions are typically aimed at smoothing out excessive volatility rather than reversing long-term trends, but they send a strong signal to the market that the government is serious about its currency. Conditions for Intervention: Intervention is usually considered when currency movements are deemed ‘one-sided,’ ‘speculative,’ or ‘excessive,’ causing significant harm to the economy. The current slide fits some of these criteria, especially given the rapid pace of depreciation. Officials are likely watching for a specific level or speed of decline that crosses their comfort threshold. Challenges and Risks: While intervention can provide temporary relief, its effectiveness is often debated. The Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy is the primary driver of yen weakness. Unless there’s a shift in this policy, any intervention might be fighting against fundamental economic forces. Moreover, repeated interventions can deplete foreign reserves and may not be sustainable in the long run. International coordination, particularly with the U.S. Treasury, is also a key factor for successful intervention. Actionable Insight: Market participants, including those in crypto, should watch for official statements that escalate from ‘concern’ to ‘strong concern’ or ‘decisive action.’ These linguistic shifts often precede actual intervention. Furthermore, monitoring the spread between Japanese and U.S. interest rates will provide clues on the fundamental pressure points for the yen, even if Forex intervention Japan temporarily stabilizes the currency. Challenges and Actionable Insights The core challenge for Japan is balancing its desire for economic growth and stable inflation with the risks of an overly weak yen. The current monetary policy, while designed to stimulate the economy, directly contributes to currency depreciation. Any move towards tightening policy would strengthen the yen but could also stifle fragile economic recovery. For investors, especially those with global portfolios or an interest in the interconnectedness of traditional finance and digital assets, the situation offers several insights: Diversification: Events like the yen’s slide highlight the importance of diversified portfolios, not just across asset classes but also geographically. Currency risk is a real factor. Macro Awareness: Even in the crypto space, understanding macro-economic indicators like interest rate differentials, inflation, and central bank policies is crucial. These factors influence global liquidity and investor appetite for risk assets. Monitoring Official Commentary: Keep a close eye on statements from finance ministers and central bank governors. Their words often precede policy actions that can significantly impact markets. Impact on Trade & Supply Chains: A weak yen can make Japanese goods cheaper globally, potentially boosting exports but also increasing the cost of imports into Japan. This can affect global supply chains and prices for consumers worldwide. Conclusion The alarming Japan Yen volatility and its slide to a four-month low are more than just a headline; they represent a critical juncture for the Japanese economy and a significant development in global financial markets. While a weaker yen offers some advantages to exporters and tourism, its inflationary impact on consumers and importers is a growing concern. The Yen depreciation impact poses a dilemma for policymakers, who must weigh the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policy against the risks of an unstable currency. The Japanese economy outlook remains closely tied to how these pressures are managed. The world watches closely for signs of whether Japan will resort to Forex intervention Japan to stem the tide, a move that could temporarily stabilize the currency but might not address the underlying fundamental drivers. These currency market trends underscore the interconnectedness of the global financial system, where even seemingly local currency movements can send ripples that affect economies, trade, and investment strategies worldwide, including the evolving landscape of digital assets. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the complexities of modern finance.

The bumper quarter resulted in a diluted earnings per share of $32.60, a dramatic turnaround from a net loss of $102.6 million in the same quarter last year. The company’s explosive performance was primarily driven by its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. It has amassed a whopping 628,791 BTC on the balance sheet, purchased at a total cost of $46 billion. That stash is currently worth $72.7 billion. Strategy posts record Q2 2025 results & shares 2025 guidance. Q2 Result: $14B op. income, $10B net income, $32.60 EPS. FY2025 Earnings Guidance: $34B op. income, $24B net income, $80 EPS. FY2025 BTC Guidance: 30% BTC Yield, $20B BTC $ Gain. https://t.co/qXLqZEBcqj — Strategy (@Strategy) July 31, 2025 Saylor’s Bitcoin Mission Succeeding Strategy also achieved a 25% Bitcoin Yield year-to-date, far surpassing its full-year target ahead of schedule. This performance generated an unrealized BTC dollar gain of $13.2 billion YTD, including $14 billion in unrealized gains during Q2 alone due to Bitcoin’s price surge. Bitcoin gained 31% over the three-month period ending June 30. The firm raised its internal Bitcoin KPI targets, increasing its BTC Yield goal from 25% to 30% and its BTC $ Gain goal from $15 billion to $20 billion for the full year. “These achievements underscore the scale of our Bitcoin treasury strategy and the strength of our capital markets platform,” said Phong Le, President and CEO. “These financial results, built upon the scale and performance of our Bitcoin balance sheet, are at all-time highs for the company and rank among the most successful quarterly results across the largest public companies in the world,” added chief financial officer Andrew Kang. Executive chairman Michael Saylor said at the earnings call that the US should create a formal crypto taxonomy to clearly define when a security can be tokenized and what constitutes a commodity. “My opinion is that it would be beneficial to the market if they nail down the digital assets taxonomy.” Tether Reports Bumper Revenue The world’s largest stablecoin issuer, Tether , also boasted bumper revenues for the second quarter with $4.9 billion in profit, a 277% increase compared with the same period a year ago. The big quarter brought its year-to-date total to $5.7 billion, and of this, $3.1 billion came from recurring revenue, while an additional $2.6 billion was driven by gains on gold and Bitcoin holdings. The firm disclosed it held $162.5 billion in reserves against $157 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2025, demonstrating a strong surplus. Tether just released its quarterly attestation for Q2 2025.

2025-08-01 06:49:49,49362756,1754030989,Buterin Says Ethereum Must Never Go Down as ETH Turns 10 With Zero Downtime,"Ethereum must never go offline, the co-founder said during the network’s 10th anniversary, highlighting its decade-long record of zero downtime and its mission to safeguard digital freedom. Speaking during the network’s 10th anniversary livestream , industrial leader Buterin said constant uptime is critical to protecting digital rights and advancing human progress. The blockchain platform celebrated a decade online without a single interruption.Ethereum at 10: A Decade of Reliability and GrowthLaunched on July 30, 2015, Ethereum introduced the world’s first smart contract blockchain. It aimed to give developers an open platform to build decentralized applications (dApps) without intermediaries. Over the past 10 years, the network has processed billions of transactions, completed 16 major protocol upgrades, and powered entire sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and DAOs, according to Austin Griffith.Despite network congestion and numerous challenges, Ethereum has never gone offline, an achievement that Vitalik Buterin emphasized as critical to the network’s goal of supporting global digital autonomy and human coordination. Notably, Vitalik stressed that Ethereum’s global, permissionless mission depends on constant uptime and censorship resistance. Ethereum's Roadmap: From Impossible to InevitableMoreover, Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation reviewed the network’s progress, noting that many innovations once considered unfeasible are now widely adopted. He pointed to Ethereum’s transition from proof of work to proof of stake, the rise of rollups, and the increasing use of zero-knowledge technologies as milestones that reflect the network’s adaptability.Further, Beiko described Ethereum’s broader vision as turning “impossible” ideas into “inevitable” realities. Notably, this includes scaling solutions, secure identity systems, and global financial tools that operate without centralized control.Community Voices and Global ReachThe livestream featured developers, artists, and entrepreneurs from across the world. Projects like PeoplePleaser's Anime and ZK Passport’s privacy-focused ID solutions showed the range of applications being built on Ethereum.In addition, co-founder Joseph Lubin emphasized Ethereum’s broad appeal across ideologies and industries, portraying it as a foundational platform where anyone can build freely, so long as it remains permissionless and resistant to censorship.The Ethereum Foundation’s Evolving RoleShaw and Tomasz, co-executive directors of the Ethereum Foundation, said the foundation now plays more of a support role as the community matures. With over 1 million validators spread across 70 countries, Ethereum has become increasingly decentralized.They said the foundation would focus on stewarding Ethereum’s core values, which are privacy, decentralization, and user empowerment, while the broader community leads the next wave of development.A New Decade Begins for Ethereum To mark the anniversary, a symbolic “Ethereum torch” NFT was passed across ten contributors before being permanently burned on-chain. The ceremony represented both the network’s decentralized history and its ongoing evolution.As Ethereum enters its second decade, developers say the next priorities include improving user experience, enhancing privacy tools, and scaling to serve billions of users. However, one principle remains unchanged: Ethereum must always stay online.Anniversary Fails to Propel Ethereum but Analysts Eye $400Meanwhile, as it marks its 10-year anniversary, ETH is again approaching the $4,000 resistance zone despite a recent pullback, with market analyst Benjamin Cowen suggesting it may finally break through. After surging more than 50% over the past month, Ethereum is now trading at $3,671, down 4.8% in the past 24 hours. Cowen noted that Ethereum has repeatedly failed to clear the $4,000 level in 2024, citing three major rejections in March, May, and December. He attributed the struggle to a missed retest of key support, which Ethereum corrected with an April dip to $1,385. Since then, ETH has rebounded sharply but remains nearly 21% below its all-time high of $4,891 recorded in 2021. Cowen believes this recovery may provide the momentum needed to finally overcome the $4,000 barrier and set new highs.",Market|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today|Vitalik Buterin News Today,EN,1,ethereum must never go offline said network anniversary highlighting record zero downtime mission safeguard digital freedom speaking network anniversary livestream industrial leader buterin said constant uptime critical protecting digital right advancing human progress blockchain platform celebrated decade online without single decade reliability growthlaunched july ethereum introduced world first smart contract blockchain aimed give developer open platform build decentralized application dapps without intermediary past year network processed billion transaction completed major protocol upgrade powered entire sector decentralized finance defi nfts daos according austin network congestion numerous challenge ethereum never gone offline achievement vitalik buterin emphasized critical network goal supporting global digital autonomy human coordination notably vitalik stressed ethereum global permissionless mission depends constant uptime censorship resistance ethereum roadmap impossible inevitablemoreover tim beiko ethereum foundation reviewed network progress noting many innovation considered unfeasible widely adopted pointed ethereum transition proof work proof stake rise rollups increasing use technology milestone reflect network beiko described ethereum broader vision turning impossible idea inevitable reality notably includes scaling solution secure identity system global financial tool operate without centralized voice global reachthe livestream featured developer artist entrepreneur across world project like peoplepleaser anime zk passport id solution showed range application built addition joseph lubin emphasized ethereum broad appeal across ideology industry portraying foundational platform anyone build freely long remains permissionless resistant ethereum foundation evolving roleshaw tomasz director ethereum foundation said foundation play support role community matures million validators spread across country ethereum become increasingly said foundation would focus stewarding ethereum core value privacy decentralization user empowerment broader community lead next wave new decade begin ethereum mark anniversary symbolic ethereum torch nft passed across ten contributor permanently burned ceremony represented network decentralized history ongoing ethereum enters second decade developer say next priority include improving user experience enhancing privacy tool scaling serve billion user however one principle remains unchanged ethereum must always stay fails propel ethereum analyst eye mark anniversary eth approaching resistance zone despite recent pullback market analyst benjamin cowen suggesting may finally break surging past month ethereum trading past hour cowen noted ethereum repeatedly failed clear level citing three major rejection march may december attributed struggle missed retest key support ethereum corrected april dip since eth rebounded sharply remains nearly high recorded cowen belief recovery may provide momentum needed finally overcome barrier set new high,0.064,0.778,0.158,0.989,1
2025-08-01 06:49:00,49346448,1754030940,Institutional Money Is Moving Into The Ethereum Ecosystem; Here Are The Top ETH Token Price Predictions,"Recently, there has been an unprecedented influx of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, with data showing billions in record-breaking monthly inflows. The Ethereum ETF spot approval and rising DeFi dominance have continued leading the way as institutional money keeps flowing in. However, with the inflow comes a surge in attention to Ethereum top tokens such as AAVE, Remittix , and Ethena. But with these tokens seeing renewed pump, here is a look into Ethena price direction and what AAVE price prediction looks like this month. Ethereum Price Inches Closer To A $4,000 Breakout The Ethereum ETF has continued extending its rising Ethereum ETF inflow with a record 17-day extension. Ethereum’s global reach with the ETF has also continued pushing the token closer to a new bull breakout as traders eye $4,000. However, fundamental factors have proven instrumental in the rising Ethereum price as new announcements keep adding to the large inflow. One of the latest updates analysts are eyeing lately is the news of Deutsche Bank’s tokenization platform on Ethereum. Therefore, with new projects such as the BlackRock BUIDL fund and Sharplink Gaming, experts remain bullish on rising inflows to Ethereum. AAVE Price Prediction With Growing Ethereum Ecosystem Boost Top AAVE price prediction speculates a 100% rise before November this year. The bullish season is a factor experts believe could boost the AAVE price as Ethereum leads the altseason. Moreover, as institutional traders continue moving millions into Ethereum, AAVE price prediction continues to stand stronger. However, while a whale withdrawal last week gave the AAVE price prediction a shakeup, new Metamask integration is renewing the hope. This is a new AAVE Price prediction suggests a potential high of over $500 before the end of the year. Can Ethena Price Hold On To New Gain? Ethena price surge joined the ranks of the major breakouts last week, with a bullish stretch recording over 140% in the last 30 days. The Ethereum rising inflow is projected to see the Ethena price hit a new high this year, with a target $1.50. The Ethena price setup shows 3 bullish candles breaking out above the 50 SMA on the weekly chart, fueling bullish sentiment. A growth in Ethereum staking yield is projected to see Ethena price rise to $4 before mid-2026. How Remittic PayFi Revolution is Redefining Crypto Remittix is another Ethereum token growing to be the best this year, with utility and adoption. While Remittix is new to the ecosystem, its fast climb in the last few weeks shows it could soon take over the market. This includes a breakout surge in presale already hitting $17.9 million, making it the best crypto presale of 2025. The Remittix solution is not feeding off hype, but rather on a solidly built utility that analysts believe could be the future of crypto payment. Below are some of the features making Remittix stand out at the moment: Cross border solution that allows a direct to bank crypto to fiat payment Support for crypto-to-fiat payment to more than 30 countries Low entry boosts investors’ chances of a higher profit margin Beta wallet launch for smooth crypto-to-bank payout With Remittix set to launch in the coming weeks, experts forecast up to 30x in breakout after hitting the exchange.

2025-08-01 06:47:44,49346389,1754030864,Bitcoin Briefly Dips to $114.5K as Tariff Fears and Profit-Taking Hit Markets,"Bitcoin has slipped by 2.56% in the past 24 hours, driving the price down below $114,500 briefly in the early Asia trading hours on Friday. The world’s largest crypto is trading at $115.7K at the time of writing, per CoinMarketCap . Bitcoin, after hitting a record high of over $123,000 on July 14, has plunged lower, and is now awaiting a macro catalyst. Renewed White House tariffs on Asian markets have further pulled the price. Stock markets across the Asia Pacific region closed with shares sinking further, as historic new tariffs announced by the United States weigh on their performance. However, Bitcoin remains range-bound. Stability at this level suggests institutional investors are largely holding their positions rather than exiting, except for Galaxy Digital’s massive BTC sale last week . Third Round of Profit-Taking Wave Hits BTC: CryptoQuant Per on-chain data firm CryptoQuant, Bitcoin just experienced its third major profit-taking spike of the bull run. “Realized profits spiked to $6–8B in late July, on par with March and Dec 2024 peaks,” the firm wrote on X. “It was new whales who led the selling above $120K.” Bitcoin just saw its third major profit-taking wave of this bull run.

It was new whales who led the selling above $120K. pic.twitter.com/Q4FQkLXcin — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 31, 2025 The data provider further said that new cohorts of whales, who accumulated BTC within the last 155 days, were among the dominant sellers. Previous profit-taking events have led to a two- to four-month period of consolidation before the next higher level, CryptoQuant wrote in a report . It added that the pattern is playing out again with diminishing US investor appetite. “In the near term, Bitcoin may continue to trade sideways as markets absorb macroeconomic signals, but a rise in inflation expectations or renewed institutional inflows could provide the momentum needed for another push toward its previous high and possibly even a new all‑time high,” James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, told Cryptonews. Besides, CryptoQuant also noted that it expects “renewed accumulation and a subsequent breakout to a new all-time high.” The post Bitcoin Briefly Dips to $114.5K as Tariff Fears and Profit-Taking Hit Markets appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Whale|CryptoQuant,EN,0,bitcoin slipped past hour driving price briefly early asia trading hour friday world largest crypto trading time writing per coinmarketcap bitcoin hitting record high july plunged lower awaiting macro catalyst renewed white house tariff asian market pulled price stock market across asia pacific region closed share sinking historic new tariff announced united state weigh performance however bitcoin remains stability level suggests institutional investor largely holding position rather exiting except galaxy digital massive btc sale last week third round wave hit btc cryptoquant per data firm cryptoquant bitcoin experienced third major spike bull run realized profit spiked late july par march dec peak firm wrote x new whale led selling bitcoin saw third major wave bull run realized profit spiked late july par march dec peak new whale led selling july data provider said new cohort whale accumulated btc within last day among dominant seller previous event led period consolidation next higher level cryptoquant wrote report added pattern playing diminishing u investor appetite near term bitcoin may continue trade sideways market absorb macroeconomic signal rise inflation expectation renewed institutional inflow could provide momentum needed another push toward previous high possibly even new high james toledano chief operating officer unity wallet told cryptonews besides cryptoquant also noted expects renewed accumulation subsequent breakout new post bitcoin briefly dip tariff fear hit market appeared first cryptonews,0.029,0.868,0.103,0.9393,1

2025-08-01 06:40:41,49346260,1754030441,European firms are struggling to adapt to Trump's tariffs,"President Trump’s new tariffs start Friday, and European firms are rushing to adapt. Some are delaying shipments, others are raising prices, and a few warn that tighter profits could threaten their survival. From small winery estates to major consumer-brand manufacturers, companies are preparing for an influx of expenses that impact alter how they do business with American partners. Under the rules coming into force this week, Washington will impose a 15 % duty on the bulk of goods arriving from Europe. These fees are part of broader penalties to resolve old disputes. Though lower than the 25% and 30% once proposed, this is still the biggest U.S. tariff on European goods in almost 100 years as per Reuters . “Companies are waking up to the fact that we’re dealing with an historically higher tariff rate,” said Andrew Wilson, a vice chief at the International Chamber of Commerce. He emphasized that without a major downturn in the American economy, it is unlikely these tariffs will be rolled back. The ICC has recorded a surge in postponed shipments and is observing corporations overhaul their distribution networks. “Trading with the United States is now hellishly more difficult,” he added, describing the new level of complexity as something “nobody could have imagined.” Out in the Moselle Valley region of Germany, winemaker Johannes Selbach noted that the tariffs add expenses to exporters and importers alike. “We were hoping for zero-for-zero tariffs, but for now we all take a 15% hit,” he said, standing amid stacks of wooden wine crates marked “USA.” Selbach cautioned that multitudes of families working in Europe’s vineyards, along with those engaged in U.S. distribution and hospitality, rely on this exchange. He warned that tighter margins could force employee cuts and shrink earnings from grape to glass. Trump’s tariff impact will differ across industries Premium brands have more leeway to transfer these surcharges onto wealthy buyers, while global corporations absorb some losses or shift portions of their manufacturing nearer to U.S. markets. Household names like Procter & Gamble have hinted at raising stateside shelf prices before year-end, and Adidas has also suggested modest markups to offset the tariff costs. Trump says these tariffs are needed to fix trade imbalances and revive U.S. manufacturing, believing they’ll bring jobs back by encouraging companies to produce at home. However, relocation is not practical for products tied to single region. Champagne vines, for instance, only grow in their original terroir. “This work is done here,” said Hugo Drappier. “We don’t have the option of relocating champagne vines.” He said some U.S. orders are on hold because the tariff outlook is unclear, but he’s cautiously hopeful talks could win his industry an exemption, and he prefers 15% over the 30% that was once threatened. Corania, a small family-operated fragrance house on the outskirts of Marseille, confronts comparable challenges. Laurent Cohen, the CEO, estimated that roughly 25 % of his revenue comes from the United States. With the tariff levels now defined, he is exploring new regions and crafting plans to preserve his presence in the U.S. He conceded that profit margins are likely to shrink and that American consumers could face higher price tags. “I praise the fact that we are no longer in a state of uncertainty,” he said. “But with 15% customs duty on our affordable perfumes, we will now have to show immense ingenuity to keep going in the U.S. market.” Meanwhile, European futures suggest a weak start, with London’s FTSE 100 set to open about 0.2% down, France’s CAC 40 flat, Germany’s DAX off roughly 0.6%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB down 0.1%. The Stoxx Europe 600 and Euro Stoxx 50 are each poised to open lower by 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-08-01 06:40:10,49346000,1754030410,UK Crypto Investment Firm Vaultz Capital Secures Remarkable $3.4M Funding Boost,"BitcoinWorld UK Crypto Investment Firm Vaultz Capital Secures Remarkable $3.4M Funding Boost In a significant development for the burgeoning digital asset landscape, particularly within the United Kingdom, Vaultz Capital , a prominent UK crypto investment firm, has announced a substantial funding injection. This strategic financial boost, totaling an additional £2.6 million ($3.4 million) from digital marketing agency Aura Digital, brings their cumulative funding to an impressive £4.3 million ($5.7 million). This news, initially shared via a company notice by @btcNLNico on X, underscores the growing confidence in specialized digital asset operators and highlights a pivotal moment for UK crypto investment and its infrastructure development. The Remarkable Boost for UK Crypto Investment The recent funding round is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving maturity and potential within the UK crypto investment sector. Vaultz Capital, formerly known as Helium Ventures, has successfully navigated a strategic pivot, demonstrating adaptability and foresight in a rapidly changing market. This substantial capital infusion not only strengthens their operational capacity but also signals a broader trend of institutional and strategic interest in the foundational elements of the crypto economy. Let’s break down the funding journey so far: Initial Funding: £1.7 million ($2.3 million) Latest Round (Aura Digital): £2.6 million ($3.4 million) Total Funding Secured: £4.3 million ($5.7 million) Current Fundraising Target: Pursuing an additional £6 million This progressive accumulation of capital positions Vaultz Capital as a key player in the UK crypto investment scene, particularly as they embark on an ambitious £6 million fundraising round. Such significant figures reflect a robust belief in their business model and their long-term vision. From Helium Ventures to Vaultz Capital: A Strategic Evolution in UK Crypto Investment The transformation from Helium Ventures to Vaultz Capital is a critical part of their narrative, showcasing a deliberate strategic shift. Originally, Helium Ventures might have had a broader or different focus. However, the rebranding and subsequent funding rounds indicate a sharpened direction, specifically towards revenue generation through active participation in Bitcoin network infrastructure. This evolution is not uncommon in the dynamic world of digital assets. Companies often refine their strategies to align with market demands, technological advancements, and emerging opportunities. For Vaultz Capital, this pivot, initiated around June, has clearly resonated with investors like Aura Digital, who see value in their specialized approach to the UK crypto investment landscape. The strategic shift highlights: Focused Approach: Moving from a potentially broader scope to a specialized niche within Bitcoin infrastructure. Revenue Generation: Emphasizing active participation to create sustainable income streams, a crucial factor for long-term viability in the crypto space. Market Responsiveness: Adapting to capitalize on the growing need for robust and efficient blockchain infrastructure. What Does This Funding Mean for UK Crypto Investment and Bitcoin Infrastructure? Vaultz Capital’s focus on generating revenue by actively participating in Bitcoin network infrastructure is a strategic move with significant implications for the broader UK crypto investment ecosystem. Bitcoin’s network relies on a complex web of participants – miners, node operators, developers, and service providers – all contributing to its security, decentralization, and efficiency. By engaging directly in this infrastructure, Vaultz Capital aims to tap into a fundamental and often overlooked segment of the crypto economy. This involvement could include activities such as: Bitcoin Mining Operations: Investing in and managing large-scale mining facilities, leveraging energy-efficient solutions. Node Operation: Running full Bitcoin nodes to support network decentralization and validate transactions. Layer-2 Solutions: Contributing to or building infrastructure for scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility for faster, cheaper transactions. Staking and Validation (indirectly): While Bitcoin itself doesn’t have native staking in the same way as Proof-of-Stake chains, firms can engage in activities that support network security and earn rewards. The funding enables Vaultz Capital to scale these operations, potentially leading to increased network stability, efficiency, and broader adoption of Bitcoin in the UK. For UK crypto investment, this signifies a move beyond speculative trading towards more foundational and operational aspects of the digital asset space, creating more resilient and revenue-generating business models. Navigating the Future of UK Crypto Investment: Opportunities and Challenges The UK has positioned itself as a hub for financial innovation, and the crypto sector is no exception. However, navigating this landscape comes with its unique set of opportunities and challenges for any UK crypto investment firm: Opportunities: Regulatory Clarity: The UK is actively working towards a clearer regulatory framework for crypto assets, which can attract more institutional investment and foster innovation. Talent Pool: London, in particular, boasts a deep pool of financial and tech talent, essential for building sophisticated crypto operations. Growing Demand: Increasing mainstream interest and adoption of digital assets create a fertile ground for businesses providing essential infrastructure. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with traditional finance institutions can bridge the gap between old and new economies. Challenges: Regulatory Evolution: While clarity is improving, the regulatory landscape is still evolving, posing compliance challenges. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of crypto markets can impact revenue streams and investment valuations. Competition: The sector is becoming increasingly competitive, requiring firms to innovate constantly. Technological Advancements: Keeping pace with rapid technological changes and security demands is crucial. Vaultz Capital’s focus on infrastructure could provide a more stable revenue base compared to firms solely reliant on asset price appreciation, potentially mitigating some of these challenges.

2025-07-31 20:32:55,49319951,1753993975,CoinDCX Software Engineer Arrested in Connection to $44 Million Hack (Report),"The Indian exchange is the latest victim of bad actors exploiting vulnerabilities and taking control of internal systems, resulting in millions of dollars being lost. The losses this year, overall, are already in the billions, and, regrettably, continue to increase at an alarming pace. Details on What Happened A local Indian news outlet, The Times of India, shared the story about Rahul Agarwal, a staff member of the CoinDCX exchange, whose login information was compromised. He has been taken into custody by Bengaluru authorities, reportedly linked to a ₹379-crore ($44 million) exploit of funds. The alarm was raised following a complaint by Nebilo Technologies, the company that runs the exchange. Their Vice President for public policy, Hardeep Singh, stated the following: “Rahul had a permanent role within the company, and he was provided with a laptop strictly for work. Our investigation began after we discovered that an unknown person had gained unauthorized access to our systems on July 19th, around 2:30 am, by transferring 1 USDT to an external wallet. Several hours later, around 9:30 a.m., the $44 million was siphoned off and distributed among six wallets. During his questioning by the police, Agarwal maintained his innocent stance, claiming he knew nothing about the hack. However, he did admit to “moonlighting” (working a second job outside regular business hours) with three to four private parties, without thoroughly vetting them. It’s further noted that the accused received ₹15 lakh (~$17,000) in his personal bank account from an unknown source. The Bengaluru police also point out that Agarwal claimed to have received a phone call from a German phone number, stating he “had a few files to complete.” He believes one of those files was fitted with malware, which granted the attackers access to CoinDCX’s internal systems, and he remained adamant that he was unaware of what was happening until the company summoned him. The exchange’s founder and CEO, Sumit Gupta, shared the bitter news of the attack on X, calling it a “sophisticated social engineering attack,” but without being able to disclose any further information on what had transpired. Some media reports have surfaced referencing the FIR we filed with the Karnataka Police regarding the security incident that impacted our platform. As this is an ongoing investigation, we unfortunately cannot engage with the media or public on this issue. We want to ensure the… — Sumit Gupta (CoinDCX) (@smtgpt) July 31, 2025 Hefty Losses Unfortunately, the attacks on crypto exchanges are on the rise, increasing in complexity, and the damage to their coffers is significant. The most notable example is the hack on Bybit in February, which resulted in a $1.5 billion loss, linked to the North Korean Lazarus Group. Overall, 2025 has seen enormous amounts of funds stolen, topping records from previous years only during the first half of the year. These incidents serve as an example of how geopolitical tensions, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and sophisticated adversaries continue to pose a significant risk to even well-established cryptocurrency platforms.

August has been bitcoin's weakest month over the past decade, with only three positive years and others delivering 5–20% losses, the report noted. The report also flagged a slowdown in capital flows into the Bitcoin network, a key driver of price action this year. Total cumulative inflows into the network now exceed $1 trillion, with $206 billion arriving in 2025. But the 30‑day rolling average slipped from $62.4 billion to $59.3 billion, that could mark the start of a consolidation phase, the report said, mirroring past peaks in this metric like in Q1 and Q4 2024. “Time is running short, and despite billions in capital inflows from corporate treasuries, the actual price impact has been surprisingly muted,” wrote Markus Thielen, co-founder and lead analyst at 10x. “This raises the possibility that even with continued support, the market may fall short of delivering the kind of upside many are hoping for.” The report forecasts a likely break below $117,000, with support at $112,000 and a deeper floor around the $106,000–$110,000 threshold. Still, BTC bulls may cling to the hope that the outlier August gains happened in 2013, 2017 and 2021, during Bitcoin's post-halving years coinciding with roaring bull markets. And 2025 might be a year just like those.

2025-07-31 20:30:52,49320467,1753993852,Grayscale Launches Story Trust to Back Blockchain-Based IP,"Grayscale, the world’s largest digital asset-focused investment firm, has taken a bold new step into the future of digital rights and artificial intelligence (AI). On July 31, the company announced the launch of the Grayscale Story Trust. This new fund provides accredited investors with a direct investment opportunity in IP, the token powering the Story network. This blockchain platform is built to redefine intellectual property (IP) for the AI era. A Shift From Fragmented Systems to Programmable Assets According to Grayscale , Story is not just another blockchain project. It is designed to make intellectual property programmable, traceable, and enforceable on-chain. As AI systems become smarter and more widespread, there is a growing need for trusted, licensed data. Story helps solve this by building legal and licensing rules directly into smart contract-based tokens. This makes it easier for creators, companies, and even AI systems to register, remix, and monetize IP safely and legally. Furthermore, Traditional IP systems are usually slow, complicated, and often rely on many middlemen. They are not made for today’s fast-moving digital world. Story offers a new solution by turning IP into programmable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These digital collectibles include built-in rules for ownership, usage, and royalties. Grayscale’s Story Attracts Strong Interest and Real-World Use Story is gaining traction, with over 1.7 million IP transactions already completed on the network. Reportedly, the new network service now supports more than 200,000 monthly users. Users range from global brands and artists to advanced AI platforms. The network also supports unique projects like Poseidon. This project delivers real-world data to intelligent machines, including robots, autonomous vehicles, and medical assistants. With the IP token now offered through a Grayscale Trust, investors have a new way to join the movement toward programmable ownership. Grayscale Opens New Door to the $80 Trillion IP Economy Intangible assets like IP and software are now worth over $80 trillion worldwide, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization’s 2025 Global Innovation Index. As more creators and companies seek to control and monetize their digital assets, platforms like Story provide a modern and scalable solution. The Grayscale Story Trust is now open for daily subscription by accredited investors. It operates similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset trusts and holds only IP tokens. It is important to note that this investment comes with risks. Like other private placements, the IP token is speculative and not easy to sell. Grayscale, currently processing to go public , emphasized that digital assets can be very volatile. Also, there is no promise that the Trust’s shares will be traded on any secondary market. Investors are advised to hold their shares for a long time, and there is even the possibility that they may lose their entire investment.

2025-07-31 20:29:51,49319828,1753993791,Best Non-Custodial Wallets for Crypto in 2025 (With Pros & Cons),"“Not your keys, not your crypto.” What began as a rallying cry among early Bitcoiners is now a principle backed by billions in lost user funds and a decade of crypto evolution. These secure and versatile wallet options will help you manage crypto on your terms—below are our top picks. In crypto, ownership is defined by access to private keys. When your assets sit on a centralized exchange or in a custodial wallet, they’re not truly yours—you’re trusting a third party to act in your interest and remain solvent. History has shown how fragile that trust can be. In 2022, $3.7 billion in customer funds were lost in the collapse of custodial platforms like Voyager, BlockFi, and Zipmex—with users often ranking below institutional creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. When FTX filed for bankruptcy, over 1 million users lost access to their accounts overnight—despite having full balances visible in the app. Why Going Non-Custodial? By contrast, users holding funds in non-custodial wallets were unaffected: no lockups, no withdrawals paused — an uninterrupted ownership. In 2025, the tools for self-custody are faster, safer, and more intuitive than ever before. Whether you're swapping tokens across chains, holding stablecoins, or exploring DeFi, the best non-custodial wallets give you complete control—without compromising usability. This guide ranks the most powerful and accessible wallets today based on security, UX, chain support, and smart DeFi features, including options for beginners and advanced users alike. 1. AliceBob Wallet — Overall Best Non‑Custodial Wallet Why it leads: Truly self‑custodial, with private keys generated and stored on your device only—no server access by AliceBob Adheres to OWASP MASVS and uses advanced cryptographic methods (BIP32/39/44) for hierarchical deterministic wallets to protect your digital assets from security risks. Supports 1,000+ assets across 300+ chains, including Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism—higher than most competitors, with built‑in fiat purchase and cross‑chain swaps Smart swap and fiat on-ramp aggregator, real‑time insights, token-level analytics, and UX designed for both beginners and power users 2. Exodus Wallet — Best for DeFi & Browser-Based dApp Access Best for: Aesthetic multi‑chain support with integrated swaps Non‑custodial: you alone hold the private keys and recovery phrase Supports 100+ blockchains, including Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche, and more Supports staking, NFT viewing, and hundreds of tokens via built‑in exchange providers but no DEX aggregator; recently added XOPay card integration for native crypto purchases inside the wallet Great UI, among the best in the market, but fewer advanced swap and fiat on-ramp aggregate features compared to AliceBob 3. MyEtherWallet (MEW) — Best for Ethereum Purists & Open-Source Accountability Best for: Ethereum-native users and open‑source purists One of the original Ethereum wallets, fully non-custodial and open-source Accessible via mobile, web, or extension, though focused almost exclusively on Ethereum ecosystem Allows ENS integration, NFT management, and hardware wallet access (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) Strong community trust and educational onboarding for beginners 4. Gem Wallet — Best for XRP Ledger Users Best for: XRP Ledger users and lightweight DeFi access Non‑custodial: private keys stored locally with zero server access Offers intuitive interface, biometric lock, and open‑source ethos Clean option for XRP ecosystem users and DeFi adopters Great for fast transfers and small transactions but lacks broader multichain utility 5. Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) — Best for Multisig & Shared Control Best for: shared wallets, DAOs, and team use cases Non‑custodial multisignature wallet: no single point of control Integrates with dozens of protocols and hardware wallets, compatible with EVM chains like Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Arbitrum, and Polygon Supports modular plugins, smart contract automation, and integrations with WalletConnect and hardware wallets Offers multi-user security governance and multisig flexibility; setup and gas fees can be a barrier for solo users Side-by-Side Comparison Wallet Custody Key Storage Chain Support Notable Features Best For AliceBob Wallet Non-Custodial Local (user device) 300+ chains incl. Solana, XRP, ETH Smart aggregator, fiat onramp, gas analytics, token insights Overall Best Exodus Wallet Non-Custodial Local 100+ incl. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Staking, XOPay, Trezor support, NFT portfolio DeFi users & UI-focused holders MyEtherWallet (MEW) Non-Custodial Local Ethereum & ERC-20 tokens Open-source, ENS, hardware wallet support, smart contract interaction Ethereum-native users & open-source advocates Gem Wallet Non-Custodial Local XRP Ledger Biometric auth, DEX access, xApp integration XRP ecosystem Safe (Gnosis Safe) Non-Custodial Multisig (smart contract) EVM-compatible Multisig governance, plugin architecture, DAO tools Shared wallets, treasury managers, DAOs Final Verdict AliceBob Wallet takes the top spot for offering a rare balance: advanced features like cross-chain swaps and real-time gas insights with a UX accessible to beginners. Its support for 300+ chains makes it the most versatile all-around pick for 2025. Exodus Wallet is best suited for users who want an elegant interface, built-in fiat and NFT tools, and a non-technical entry point into self-custody. MyEtherWallet (MEW) remains the go-to for Ethereum purists who value open-source code, transparency, and long-standing trust in the ETH ecosystem. Gem Wallet is ideal for XRP users wanting a clean, biometric-secured wallet tailored for the XRP Ledger. Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) leads for shared governance and team-based wallets, thanks to multisig architecture trusted by DAOs and institutions.

The Helium team, whose project is powered by the Solana blockchain, says the new solution marks a significant step toward expanding community-driven wireless coverage. Helium’s announcement could be a major boost to the HNT token . Helium targets growth with new Helium Plus service On July 31, 2025, Helium made a huge announcement . The platform announced the launch of Helium Plus, a transformative service designed to integrate existing Wi-Fi networks into its people-powered Helium Network. According to a blog post, the project aims to eliminate the need for businesses to invest in specialized hardware, such as physical Hotspots, as they look to join the network. This is a previous requirement businesses had to comply with before contributing to the network. Helium🎈 @helium · Follow Introducing Helium Plus: Empowering Everyone to Participate ➕Turn your existing Wi-Fi into a revenue stream! Instantly join the people-powered Network with a simple software upgrade – no new hardware needed. Expand coverage & earn.Read the news: blog.helium.com/helium-plus-51… 9:42 PM · Jul 31, 2025 86 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies Helium Plus removes this need, allowing venues such as coffee shops or shopping centers to join the network via a simple software upgrade. This tweak applies to users’ Wi-Fi routers, with a seamless integration set to significantly lower the barriers that have impacted participation. “Helium Plus represents a major leap forward in how businesses can contribute to the Helium Network,” said Mario Di Dio, general manager at Helium. “It offers instant, low-cost wireless integration, reducing infrastructure costs while creating new revenue streams and improving connectivity. The simplicity of our process is key to unlocking the full potential of this expansion.” Helium says the new feature will accelerate growth and availability of reliable Wi-Fi coverage. Key markets in this community-driven wireless initiative are the United States and Mexico. Coverage and reduced costs Helium Plus aims to enable a broader range of businesses to provide wireless coverage and share in the network’s success. Monetizing these offerings can allow businesses to earn HNT or US dollars. Helium’s payouts for carrier offload data were $300k in June, with rewards increasing by 20% month-over-month. In April this year, Helium revealed a strategic collaboration with American communications giant AT&T. The partnership targeted bringing Helium’s decentralized wireless network to AT&T subscribers in the US, with AT&T customers able to tap into Helium for community-built Wi-Fi connection. Helium and AT&T said at the time the goal was to expand coverage and bolster mobile service. “Beyond creating value for individual businesses, Helium Plus is designed to supercharge the entire Helium ecosystem. It directly fuels the Helium Network’s powerful carrier offload capability, which enables major US carriers to route customer data through The People’s Network,enhancing their coverage and cutting operational costs,” the platform wrote.

2025-07-31 20:24:22,49319624,1753993462,Coinbase Stock Tumbles 7% After Disappointing Q2 Results,"Coinbase (COIN) reported worse than expected second-quarter results on Thursday, sending its shares down 7% in post-market trading. The crypto exchange posted total revenue of $1.5 billion, up from $1.45 billion in the same quarter last year but slightly lower than FactSet estimates of $1.59 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) came in at $512 million, down from $596 million a year ago. The results show Coinbase’s continued sensitivity to crypto market cycles. Even though bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied to new yearly highs during the second quarter, transaction volume fell from a quarter-to-quarter basis, Coinbase said in a press release. As a result, transaction revenue was $764 million, a 39% drop from the first quarter. Coinbase’s report follows an upbeat performance from rival Robinhood (HOOD), which reported its own quarterly results on Wednesday. HOOD, which is up 160% year-to-date, beat expectations as the company saw $28.3 billion in crypto trading volume in the second quarter. Coinbase, meanwhile, continues to lean into its dual identity as both a retail trading hub and institutional crypto infrastructure provider. The company has launched custody services for spot bitcoin ETFs, expanded its staking offerings and made further progress with its Base layer-2 network, though these businesses remain secondary to trading revenue. “In Q2, Coinbase made significant strides in bringing the financial system onchain by expanding access to trading through innovative derivative products, listing more spot assets, and expanding our offerings in markets globally,” the company said in its earnings release.",Markets|Coinbase|Earnings|News,EN,0,coinbase coin reported worse expected result thursday sending share trading crypto exchange posted total revenue billion billion quarter last year slightly lower factset estimate billion adjusted earnings interest tax depreciation amortization ebitda came million million year ago result show coinbase continued sensitivity crypto market cycle even though bitcoin btc ether eth rallied new yearly high second quarter transaction volume fell basis coinbase said press release result transaction revenue million drop first quarter coinbase report follows upbeat performance rival robinhood hood reported quarterly result wednesday hood beat expectation company saw billion crypto trading volume second quarter coinbase meanwhile continues lean dual identity retail trading hub institutional crypto infrastructure provider company launched custody service spot bitcoin etf expanded staking offering made progress base network though business remain secondary trading revenue coinbase made significant stride bringing financial system onchain expanding access trading innovative derivative product listing spot asset expanding offering market globally company said earnings release,0.042,0.835,0.123,0.8932,1

2025-07-31 20:24:00,49319705,1753993440,Pepe Price Prediction: Whale Selling Triggers Huge Drop – Panic Is Spreading Fast,"Pepe (PEPE) has dropped 9% over the past 7 days, underperforming most other meme coins during the latest pullback — putting the current Pepe price prediction into question. Is this a sign of deeper weakness and a bearish mid-term outlook, or just a healthy correction before the next leg up? Data from CoinDesk Research shows that whales have been offloading PEPE recently, although not all of these sales appear to be voluntary, hinting at liquidations or forced exits rather than broad loss of confidence. Whale James Wynn got liquidated again. This time he was long on $PEPE . Tough to watch him lose that much. pic.twitter.com/aSNZJbpOfA — Ted (@TedPillows) July 29, 2025 A notable PEPE trader called James Wynn, who previously made a fortune by buying the meme coin once it was an unknown token for the rest of the world, was recently liquidated out of a long position. A total of $207 million worth of long positions were impacted by PEPE’s latest drop, inflicting losses of around $180,000 to Wynn in a relatively short period. This trader, known for his high-risk strategy, has seen both massive wins and painful losses. While his approach once delivered life-changing returns, the tides have turned — he was forced out of a $1 billion Bitcoin position in May, reportedly losing around $60 million. PEPE’s open interest has also taken a hit. After peaking at $1 billion on July 22, it has since plunged sharply, suggesting that many traders — possibly similar to Wynn — have been wiped out during PEPE’s 21.4% drop from $0.000014 to $0.000011. This wave of forced exits raises a critical question: Is whale capitulation an early warning sign of a deeper correction ahead? And with price action breaking key levels, does the current structure support a bearish PEPE price prediction for the mid-term? Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Drop to $0.00000850 If It Breaks Below This Key Support Pepe’s daily chart shows that the price started to retreat upon hitting the $0.00001450 mark and dropped below the 200-day exponential moving average in the past few days. Now, the 9-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have made a ‘death cross’ as they crossed below their long-term peer. This favors a bearish Pepe price prediction and could mark the beginning of a pronounced downtrend. The key support to watch at this point is the $0.00001050 area. If PEPE breaks below this level, the odds would favor a push to a much higher zone – possibly at around $0.00000850. However, since market sentiment and momentum still favor a bullish outlook, short-selling PEPE at this point would be risky as it means going against the prevailing trend. A confirmed breakout below $0.00001050 would justify taking a short position. Whether you believe that PEPE will drop to these low levels or the opposite, you can profit from your prediction through a new crypto futures trading platform called CoinFutures that lets you take directional positions on your favorite cryptocurrencies without the hassle of doing real trading. CoinFutures Supports Auto Trading Features and Offers 1000X Leverage to Boost Gains CoinFutures allows users to profit from the future price movements of top cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) without buying these cryptocurrencies directly. Meme coins like PEPE will be added to the platform shortly as well. The platform mimics the real-time volatility and price action of the crypto market through a sophisticated algorithm and integrations with top exchanges to offer transparent pricing. Users can use a price multiplier feature to take much larger positions and potentially increase their profits if the market moves in their favor. Moreover, an auto trading tool can be used to set a stop-loss and take-profit target to limit losses and cash out when the position turns a profit. To open an account, simply head to the CoinFutures website and click the “Register” button. You can deposit money via crypto transfers of USDT, USDC, ETH, and more or use a bank card.

2025-07-31 20:23:45,49320835,1753993425,Stellar (XLM) August outlook as bullish pennant forms,"Stellar (XLM) is entering the month of August on a strong technical footing, following weeks of momentum driven by both major adoption news and emerging bullish indicators. As the token trades at around $0.40, analysts and traders are closely watching a textbook bullish pennant formation, a pattern often associated with price continuation after a rally. And with market sentiment gradually turning positive, XLM could be on the verge of a significant breakout. Bullish pennant signals a possible rally ahead The price of XLM has been consolidating between converging trendlines, forming a bullish pennant — a structure that typically emerges after a steep upward move. This consolidation suggests that the asset is gearing up for its next leg higher. Currently, Stellar (XLM) is holding steady at $0.40, trading within a narrow range that reflects market indecision but also growing pressure for a directional move. If the token breaks above the upper trendline of the pennant, a strong rally could follow. The first target is the July 18 high of $0.52. Stellar (XLM) price analysis | Source: TradingView Should bullish momentum continue, the price could then attempt to reach the November 2023 high of $0.63. The fact that this setup is forming after recent positive developments adds more weight to the bullish outlook. Visa integration lends strong fundamental support One of the most notable developments supporting XLM is its recent integration into Visa’s blockchain settlement network. Visa, a global payments giant, has added Stellar to its platform alongside Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This move allows stablecoin payments to be settled directly on Stellar’s blockchain, aligning perfectly with the project’s long-term goals of improving cross-border payment efficiency. This partnership could prove to be a major driver of adoption for Stellar. It also places the project in direct competition with XRP, a fellow cross-border payment solution that continues to face legal uncertainty in the United States. By contrast, Stellar now enjoys the backing of one of the most influential financial entities in the world, potentially giving it a competitive edge in institutional finance. Smart money is moving in as retail traders stay calm While many retail traders remain on the sidelines, on-chain data shows that institutional interest in XLM is increasing. Metrics suggest that smart money is quietly accumulating the token during this consolidation phase. Historically, low retail activity has preceded some of Stellar’s most significant rallies, as institutions take advantage of calmer market conditions to build positions. The derivatives market also reflects growing optimism. The long/short ratio for Stellar (XLM), according to Coinglass , recently hit 1.14, its highest in over a month, signalling that more traders are betting on upside. Additionally, the funding rate is positive at 0.0085%, indicating that long positions are dominant and confident. Technical indicators back the bullish Stellar (XLM) outlook Aside from the bullish pennant, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has dropped to around 52, coming from an overbought region, providing room for a substantial comeback. XLM also has clear support levels that may serve as strong accumulation zones. The area between $0.40 and $0.36 has seen consistent interest, with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.35 acting as a crucial stop-loss marker for traders. If the Stellar (XLM) price breaks below this level, the bullish structure would be invalidated, potentially leading to a deeper correction.

These new services will launch over the next few months, initially for US users, followed by a phased rollout internationally, subject to regulatory approvals, the company told CNBC today. “We’re building an all-encompassing exchange,” Coinbase Vice President of Product Max Branzburg said, explaining the company’s vision. “We’re bringing all assets on-chain: stocks, prediction markets, and more.” He added, “We’re building an on-chain, one-stop-shop for everything tradable.” Related News: BREAKING: Strategy Takes New Step Worth $4.2 Billion in Bitcoin The new services will include tokenized real-world assets, stocks, derivatives, prediction markets, and early-stage token sales. This move positions Coinbase directly against tokenized securities services offered by rivals like Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken, particularly outside the US. CEO Brian Armstrong aims to make the company “the most preferred financial services app” within the next decade.

Without the $1.5 billion lift from foreign exchange, the number still came in 12% higher year-over-year. Operating income jumped to $19.2 billion, compared to $14.7 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, up from $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, in Q2 2024. The update was announced in Seattle through a Business Wire release, and came with a clear emphasis on AI technology driving growth across nearly every part of the company. Amazon’s North America unit brought in $100.1 billion, an 11% increase. The International segment reached $36.8 billion, a 16% rise year-over-year, and 11% after adjusting for FX. Meanwhile, AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue totaled $30.9 billion, up 17.5% from the previous year. Jassy says AI is showing results across the business Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said Amazon’s internal use of AI is already having a noticeable impact on operations and customer tools. “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out,” Andy said. He pointed to the rollout of Alexa+ to millions, high usage of the shopping agent, and the launch of new tools, including DeepFleet, Kiro, Strands, and Bedrock AgentCore. Andy explained that DeepFleet is helping over a million warehouse robots find faster paths and avoid delays. He also said Kiro, Amazon’s new AI-integrated developer platform, is making it easier for engineers to code with intelligent support. He highlighted Strands, designed to help build AI agents, and AgentCore, a system for managing them at scale. Operating income for AWS came in at $10.2 billion, up from $9.3 billion a year earlier. North America’s operating profit was $7.5 billion, compared to $5.1 billion, and International operations posted $1.5 billion, a huge jump from $300 million last year. The company also reported operating cash flow of $121.1 billion, a 12% increase over the previous trailing twelve months. However, free cash flow dropped to $18.2 billion, down from $53 billion the prior year. Prime Day breaks records, new deals announced Amazon called its latest Prime Day the biggest ever, saying customers saved billions and small businesses hit record sales. The company said it would expand Same-Day and Next-Day delivery to over 4,000 smaller towns and rural areas in the U.S. by the end of 2025. New product partnerships were announced with Nike, which now has a storefront on Amazon, and other consumer brands like Aveda, Away, Marc Jacobs Fragrances, Milk Makeup, and Origins. The company also introduced new AI-powered shopping features, including a tool that reads out product highlights and reviews, and another that helps sellers keep listings fresh and detailed. Alexa+ Early Access expanded to millions more users. Two satellites were launched under the Project Kuiper initiative to build out satellite-based internet infrastructure. Amazon also named its NBA broadcast team for Prime Video, including Stan Van Gundy, Kevin Harlan, Dwyane Wade, Taylor Rooks, Blake Griffin, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, and Candace Parker. For NASCAR coverage, the company reported 2 million viewers per race, with the youngest demo among NASCAR TV partners in over 10 years. Amazon reported it has signed new AWS partnerships with companies like PepsiCo, Airbnb, Peloton, London Stock Exchange, Nissan, GitLab, SAP, Warner Bros. Discovery Sports, TwelveLabs, FICO, Iberia Airlines, SK Telecom, and NatWest Group. It also said “AI Zones” are being launched in Saudi Arabia and South Korea with local partners. AI agent listings were added to AWS Marketplace, including offerings from Anthropic, PwC, IBM, Salesforce, and Accenture. Amazon said new foundation models like Claude 4, Marengo, and Pegasus are now available on Bedrock. The company also launched Amazon EC2 machines with NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchips and Oracle Database@AWS, which helps migrate Oracle workloads to Amazon’s cloud. Amazon S3 Vectors, its vector storage tool, went live, claiming up to 90% reduction in vector handling costs. On the robotics side, the Vulcan robot was introduced, combining sight and touch to navigate spaces like a human would. The company also said its AI-powered forecasting system improved regional accuracy by 20%, allowing better delivery speeds and smarter inventory placement.

2025-07-31 20:14:13,49319210,1753992853,"Grayscale Launches IP Token Trust, Targeting $80 Trillion Market with Story Protocol","Digital asset manager Grayscale has a new investment product: the Grayscale Story Trust. It is using accredited investors to provide direct exposure to IP, the native cryptocurrency of Story Protocol. Grayscale has made a major push into blockchain-based intellectual property infrastructure this time around with its latest Bitcoin and Ethereum product. A New Frontier: Blockchain Meets Intellectual Property The Story Protocol integrates licensing , attribution, and royalty streams into on-chain assets. The smart contract-facilitated tools are especially relevant in an era rife with AI-generated content and mounting legal uncertainties surrounding data ownership. “Grayscale Story Trust offers investors exposure to a protocol that is developing the underlying intellectual property layer for the information and AI era,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Head of Product & Research at Grayscale. The trust will operate similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset products, holding IP as its sole asset and allowing regulated investment exposure to a market that is expected to be valued at $80 trillion worldwide. Real-World Demand and Use Cases Story Protocol is already processing over 1.7 million IP transactions a month, from music royalties to robotic surgery data sets. Its token, $IP, derives demand from creators and AI developers that need licensed, verifiable content — unlike the majority of speculative digital assets. This blockchain-first platform gives AI companies buying training data transparency, and also allows artists, researchers, and developers to embed immutable ownership and revenue structures directly into their work. Limited Access For Now The Grayscale Story Trust is currently offered to accredited investors only, which means individuals with $200,000+ annual income or institutions with $5 million+ in assets. Listing on the secondary market may be next, pending regulatory approval. This mirrors the strategy of Grayscale with its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, which started out as private placements and became ETFs. Those funds had $21.2 billion and $4.25 billion in AUM as of July 30, respectively. The Bigger Picture Grayscale’s foray into the IP token economy is a sign of growing institutional confidence in the viability of blockchain use cases beyond finance. With AI advancing exponentially, clean, licensed data is becoming an essential commodity — and Story Protocol’s tokenized infrastructure may offer the rails for a decentralized, transparent, and scalable intellectual property economy.",Blockchain|Sticky|Web3,EN,1,digital asset manager grayscale new investment product grayscale story trust using accredited investor provide direct exposure ip native cryptocurrency story protocol grayscale made major push intellectual property infrastructure time around latest bitcoin ethereum product new frontier blockchain meet intellectual property story protocol integrates licensing attribution royalty stream asset smart tool especially relevant era rife content mounting legal uncertainty surrounding data ownership grayscale story trust offer investor exposure protocol developing underlying intellectual property layer information ai era said rayhaneh head product research grayscale trust operate similarly grayscale product holding ip sole asset allowing regulated investment exposure market expected valued trillion worldwide demand use case story protocol already processing million ip transaction month music royalty robotic surgery data set token ip derives demand creator ai developer need licensed verifiable content unlike majority speculative digital asset platform give ai company buying training data transparency also allows artist researcher developer embed immutable ownership revenue structure directly work limited access grayscale story trust currently offered accredited investor mean individual annual income institution asset listing secondary market may next pending regulatory approval mirror strategy grayscale bitcoin ethereum trust started private placement became etf fund billion billion aum july respectively bigger picture grayscale foray ip token economy sign growing institutional confidence viability blockchain use case beyond finance ai advancing exponentially clean licensed data becoming essential commodity story protocol tokenized infrastructure may offer rail decentralized transparent scalable intellectual property economy,0.026,0.735,0.239,0.9951,1

2025-07-31 20:12:11,49319085,1753992731,Ethereum Reveals Its Plan for the Next 10 Years – It Will Focus on Two Things,"After celebrating its 10th anniversary, Ethereum announced its new vision that will mark the next 10 years: Lean Ethereum. This roadmap, which the foundation describes as a “generational promise,” aims to propel Ethereum into a new era in both performance and security. The goal: 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), quantum-resistant cryptography, and planetary sustainability. According to the Ethereum Foundation, ETH must not only scale but also “survive against all odds.” After 10 years of zero downtime, the ETH network currently has $130 billion in economic security (approximately 35.7 million ETH staked). The Foundation aims to reach $1 trillion in future security. This approach, called “Fort mode,” argues that Ethereum exists only if the internet exists; that the chain exists only if the world is online. This mode aims to make Ethereum resistant to all kinds of attacks, from government threats to quantum computers. Related News: Tether, One of the Largest Cryptocurrency Companies, Releases Its Earnings Report - Here Are Its Assets On the performance front, Ethereum is preparing to enter “beast mode.” While low-cost efficiency gains are expected over the next 6-12 months, more radical steps are coming in the long term: L1 target: 10,000 TPS capacity with Gigagas-level bandwidth L2 target: Tier-2 solutions reaching 1 million TPS with Teragas capacity This goal will be supported by innovations such as zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), data availability sampling (DAS), and full chain verification from browsers, wallets, and phones. The Lean Ethereum approach redesigns the three layers that form the foundation of ETH: Lean consensus (CL): Beacon Chain 2.0 comes with finality within seconds and superior decentralization. Lean data (DL): More flexible data processing with post-quantum compatible data blocks (blobs 2.0). Lean execution (EL): A new SNARK-compatible, minimal, but EVM-compatible virtual machine (probably based on RISC-V). The Ethereum Foundation concludes its statement with the following words: “Lean Ethereum is a generational promise to keep Ethereum online in all conditions, to scale without compromise, and to make it worthy of those who come after us.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-31 20:03:53,49320186,1753992233,Ethena price forecast for August amid the rising TVL and USD inflows,"Ethena has emerged as one of the standout performers in the DeFi space this July, surprising the market with its explosive growth. Its native token, ENA, surged over 135% within the month, while the platform’s total value locked (TVL) jumped by an over 50%, crossing the $8.679 billion mark. With bullish momentum building, investors are now asking whether ENA can sustain its uptrend through August, or if this rally is merely a temporary spike. ENA surged on whale activity and exchange listings Ethena’s price rally did not occur in isolation. Whale investors significantly influenced the uptrend by accumulating over 79 million ENA tokens in late July. This large-scale accumulation was followed by a surge in ENA trading volume, which rose from $6 billion in June to a massive $27 billion in July. Another key event that boosted the token’s profile was ENA’s listing on Upbit , South Korea’s largest crypto exchange. The listing not only expanded Ethena’s market reach but also enhanced its liquidity. This development likely played a critical role in encouraging both retail and institutional interest in the token. The token’s performance has also been supported by a wave of positive sentiment following major protocol updates. On July 21, StablecoinX announced a $360 million fund, with $260 million allocated for buying back ENA tokens. This move created a demand shock that added further momentum to the price rally. TVL and USDe adoption have driven fundamental growth While price gains are often met with scepticism, Ethena’s rising fundamentals paint a different picture. Its TVL increased from $5.46 billion to $8.679 billion within just one month, signalling strong user confidence and growing platform adoption. This 50% monthly gain also coincided with a sharp rise in platform fees, which climbed from $19.96 million in June to over $36 million in July. One of the most important catalysts for this growth is the increasing adoption of Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDe operates without fiat reserves or overcollateralization. This makes it a more capital-efficient solution, attracting a growing number of DeFi users seeking stable yet flexible alternatives. In addition, Ethena’s partnership with Anchorage Digital on July 24 marked a significant regulatory step forward. The collaboration enabled USDe to comply with the US GENIUS Act , a move that could open doors for more institutional participation soon. Ethena price action points to a critical support level Despite the bullish sentiment, ENA faces a critical test in August. The $0.60 price level has emerged as a strong psychological and technical support. Currently, the token trades slightly above this mark, having recently tested resistance levels between $0.70 and $0.75. Technical indicators suggest that ENA remains in an overall uptrend. The token trades well above both its 10-day and 50-day exponential moving averages on the daily chart, confirming the strength of the current trend. Ethena price analysis | Source: TradingView However, traders should watch the relative strength index (RSI), which is hovering around 65. If the RSI returns to overbought territory, it could signal a potential slowdown or correction, particularly if the price action falls below $0.60. Should this occur, the next key support would be the 50-day EMA near $0.50.

2025-07-31 20:00:59,49319498,1753992059,"4 Top Altcoins to Buy Today for Massive Gains: Ethereum, PEPE, TRON, & BlockDAG!","Not all altcoins maintain attention for long, but a select few are gaining serious traction as market momentum builds. From meme tokens and DeFi leaders to powerful presale stories, certain names are drawing both public attention and significant capital. Ethereum, TRON, PEPE, and BlockDAG are some of the most discussed tokens right now, each grabbing headlines for different reasons. Despite their varied strengths, all four are counted among the top altcoins to buy today. Let’s break down why these four are gaining attention as we move into the second half of 2025. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Real Utility and a Rapidly Growing Base What sets BlockDAG (BDAG) apart is its ability to build momentum well before its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. The project has already raised $357 million in presale funding and sold over 24.5 billion BDAG coins to a fast-growing community of more than 200,000. This strong support reflects actual confidence in the project’s execution rather than future potential. With this level of traction before listing, BlockDAG stands out among the top altcoins to buy today. Ease of access also plays a major role. Through the X1 Miner App, users can mine BDAG straight from their smartphones, with no special hardware or technical experience required. Already, more than 2.5 million users are actively mining, showcasing a vibrant and engaged user base. This practical use helps simplify blockchain for the average person and builds a path for mainstream expansion. The coin is priced at $0.0016 in its current batch (29), and this rate is only available until August 11th. With an expected listing price of $0.05 and early users already seeing 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, the present price level is among the most favorable entries of the year. BlockDAG clearly secures its spot among the top altcoins to buy today. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Strength from Institutional Backing Ethereum’s consistent appeal comes from its expanding support from large financial entities. The approval of spot ETH ETFs has brought in more than $8.6 billion, with institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity leading the way. July saw a record $2.1 billion in flows alone. A pending ETF based on ETH staking could soon allow income-generating exposure, bringing in more funds from long-term capital pools. ETH is now trading near $3,700 and has recently overcome key resistance. Analysts are monitoring the path to $4,000, with some predictions extending to $4,800 if institutional inflow and network strength remain intact. All these places put Ethereum confidently among the top altcoins to buy today. 3. PEPE (PEPE): Building on Meme Power with Whale Support Whale activity and increased integration are giving PEPE fresh momentum in 2025. During July alone, over 1 trillion PEPE tokens were scooped up by major wallets. This accumulation is accompanied by growing use in NFTs and Web3 games, helping transition PEPE from meme token to a more functional asset. The current price near $0.000013 shows steady action just above major technical levels. A breakout above $0.000014 could open the door to price targets around $0.000015 or higher. With a smaller market cap, PEPE has potential for sharp upside moves if momentum picks up again. This potential makes PEPE one of the top altcoins to buy today. 4. TRON (TRX): Tether Dominance and Network Growth Strong usage figures are lifting TRON’s profile in 2025. It remains the top blockchain for USDT, currently holding more than $80 billion worth and handling daily transfers exceeding $20 billion, often surpassing Ethereum. This high transaction volume underpins TRX’s growing utility across payment systems and decentralized finance. TRX is currently priced between $0.32 and $0.33, maintaining strength above key levels. Analysts are watching for a possible climb to $0.40 or even $0.45, driven by sustained demand for USDT and adoption of TRON-based apps. These developments help place TRON firmly among the top altcoins to buy today. Final Thoughts Each of these coins brings something different to the table. Ethereum continues to benefit from major financial adoption. PEPE’s whale-driven surge and gaming relevance suggest more than just hype. TRON backs its value with leading transactional volume in stablecoins. But BlockDAG sets itself apart, delivering $357 million in presale funding, over 2.5 million active miners, and 2,660% gains for early supporters, all before official trading even begins. That kind of traction and accessibility puts BlockDAG well ahead of many contenders and firmly places it among the top altcoins to buy today .

2025-07-31 20:00:32,49318605,1753992032,XRP Holders Connect the Dots As Speakers from BlackRock and Banks Ready for Ripple SWELL,"Ripple’s flagship annual event, SWELL 2025, is already making waves in the crypto world, especially within the XRP community. Scheduled for October 22–23, 2025, in London, this year’s event promises to be one of the most significant yet. With a star-studded lineup of speakers from leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, Citi, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, BNY Mellon, Nasdaq, and more, XRP holders are buzzing with anticipation and speculation. One name, in particular, is drawing intense attention: Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock. His scheduled appearance at SWELL has fueled growing hopes that BlackRock could be preparing to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , a move that would mark a monumental step in XRP’s journey toward broader institutional adoption. Crypto influencer Crypto Eri was among the first to spotlight the significance of Stein’s presence, posting the complete speaker list and urging the XRP community to “connect the dots.” Her post quickly gained traction, with many interpreting BlackRock’s involvement as a major signal of what may come next. BlackRock Director of Digital Assets at @Ripple SWELL. Just saying. https://t.co/8TgXZ7Tbos pic.twitter.com/g246P50n92 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) July 31, 2025 BlackRock’s Presence and the XRP ETF Buzz BlackRock has already made headlines by launching Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and its increased involvement in tokenized finance has only strengthened the belief that XRP could be next in line . The company’s presence at Ripple SWELL, specifically through a digital asset executive, has stoked optimism that groundwork is being laid for a potential XRP ETF filing. The timing couldn’t be more appropriate. Ripple has been steadily positioning XRP at the heart of institutional-grade financial infrastructure. With the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and growing demand for compliant cross-border payment solutions, an XRP ETF would be a logical next step for institutional investors. Major Banks and Institutions Join the Conversation Beyond BlackRock, several major financial institutions will be participating in SWELL 2025, further validating Ripple’s growing influence in traditional finance. Citi’s Ryan Rugg, Global Head of Digital Assets for Treasury & Trade Solutions, is scheduled to speak. Citi has previously explored blockchain-based settlement solutions, including partnerships aligned with Ripple’s technology. Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, known for her thought leadership in tokenization and digital asset strategy, is another high-profile speaker. Franklin Templeton has actively pursued blockchain innovation, often in parallel with Ripple’s institutional objectives. Carolyn Weinberg, Chief Product & Innovation Officer at BNY Mellon, represents a bank that has been a custodian leader in digital assets. Her presence signals a continued focus on integrating digital assets like XRP into secure, compliant custodial services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cynthia Lo Bessette, who heads Fidelity Digital Asset Management, brings the perspective of one of the earliest institutional backers of crypto infrastructure and ETFs. Her appearance adds further intrigue, especially given Fidelity’s exploration of tokenized assets. Ripple’s Leadership and Institutional Strategy Ripple’s executive team will be out in full force at SWELL, including Brad Garlinghouse (CEO) , Monica Long (President), Stuart Alderoty (Chief Legal Officer), and Jack McDonald (SVP of Stablecoins). They are expected to share critical updates on RippleNet expansion, regulatory developments, and the evolving use of XRP in liquidity solutions and global settlements. Ripple’s institutional strategy is clear: build a regulatory-compliant, scalable ecosystem where digital assets like XRP play a central role in powering the future of finance. With support from global banking leaders and top-tier asset managers, Ripple is turning that vision into reality. Connecting the Dots With speakers from BlackRock, Fidelity, Citi, BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, and others on the agenda, SWELL 2025 is shaping up to be a convergence point of institutional finance and blockchain innovation. The XRP community is not just paying attention; they’re reading between the lines. The presence of BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets at Ripple’s flagship event is no coincidence. While no XRP ETF has been officially filed, the signs are hard to ignore. From increasing institutional engagement to regulatory clarity, all the right pieces seem to be falling into place. For now, XRP holders are doing exactly what Crypto Eri suggested: connecting the dots and waiting for the next big move.

2025-07-31 20:00:17,49318771,1753992017,Bank of Russia to scrap cards issued by Visa and Mastercard,"Bank of Russia is considering dates for terminating services for cards issued by the globally accepted payment networks Mastercard and Visa. The monetary authority made it clear it’s not rushing the process, as it hopes for a gradual transition to cards based on its own payment system called Mir, but also pointed out Russians can make the change as soon as they want. Days of Mastercard and Visa cards numbered in Russia The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is preparing to phase out Visa and Mastercard payment cards, replacing them with the Russian Mir cards, TASS reported, quoting the press service of the country’s main financial regulator. The authority is currently considering a deadline for Russian banks to discontinue support for cards issued by the U.S.-headquartered corporations, the official news agency detailed. The CBR is also expecting its replacement with its own Mir cards to be gradual. A spokesperson for the institution was quoted as stating: “We are currently considering the timeline, during which the servicing of cards of international payment systems should stop. It will be reasonable and sufficient for the banks to gradually replace them with Mir cards.” The Bank of Russia emphasized that international cards are still working as usual and that there is no urgent need to pull them out yet. It also noted that commercial banks will promptly inform clients about upcoming changes. Nevertheless, the regulator highlighted that Russian users can substitute them with Mir cards at any time, if they so wish. “The decision to extend the validity period for cards of international payment systems that left the Russian market was made so that people could continue to use these cards,” the CBR remarked, but then stated: “Currently, the need for the measure has lost relevance – the share of such cards in circulation is decreasing, people themselves prefer to replace them with relevant domestic ones.” Russia to scrap foreign cards 3 years after invading Ukraine Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in the Russian Federation soon after Moscow invaded Ukraine in early 2022. Since then, their cards issued for Russian banks can be used only inside the country. After the American giants pulled out of the Russian market, local banking institutions, working with the National Payment Card System ( NSPK ), extended the validity of their cards. Earlier this month, news came out that the Central Bank of Russia intends to set a maximum validity period for all of them. The NSPK, which is wholly owned and controlled by the CBR, is Russia’s payment clearing house processing bank card transactions within its borders and the operator of the Mir card payment system. It also provides clearing for the Faster Payments System ( SBP ), which allows Russians to initiate interbank transfers using only a mobile phone number, and to make and receive payments through a QR code. Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has been preparing to launch a digital version of the national fiat. The digital ruble will be introduced in stages, starting from September 2026, the monetary authority announced in June, after President Putin called for mass adoption of the sovereign digital coin. The introduction of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be accompanied by wider implementation of payments using the universal QR code already available through the SPB, as Cryptopolitan reported last month. The days of crypto payments in Russia, strongly opposed by the CBR, also seem numbered. The Russian government has been tightening the noose on transactions with Bitcoin and the like by adopting a package of laws , targeting peer-to-peer trades and curbing crypto usage in general. The only loophole for cryptocurrency payments that is likely to remain open is the one suggested by the CBR itself. That’s the “experimental legal regime” that allows Russian companies to use digital coins in foreign trade, in order to circumvent war-related sanctions that have severely limited their access to the global financial system.

Glassnode says an unnamed investor disposed of Bitcoin worth nearly $10 billion via Galaxy Digital last weekend, demonstrating Bitcoin’s “growing liquidity profile and market depth.” “This liquidity was put to the test over the weekend, as an early Bitcoin investor, via Galaxy Digital’s services, distributed 80,000 BTC (approximately $9.6 billion), likely through a mix of market sales and [over-the-counter] OTC transactions. The resulting sell-side pressure drove the price down to $115,000 before stabilizing at $119,000. This episode illustrates Bitcoin’s ability to absorb large sell-side volumes, even during typically thinner weekend trading hours, reinforcing the market’s structural robustness.” The analytics platform says that a “super-majority” of Bitcoin holders are currently sitting on significant unrealized profits, with more than 97% of the circulating supply in the black. “This underscores how the majority of investors are sitting on substantial paper gains, and sets up an environment of potential future sell-side pressure should prices continue to rise further.” Source: Glassnode According to Glassnode, profit-taking could “sharply intensify” if Bitcoin goes up by around 20% from the current level. “…Bitcoin may remain range-bound between $105,000 and $125,000 until a decisive breakout occurs. Should the market break convincingly higher, the $141,000 region is likely to present the next major zone of resistance where sell-side pressure may intensify rapidly…” Bitcoin is trading at $117,651 at time of writing.

2025-07-31 20:00:00,49318569,1753992000,"Weak Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Be Crushed By Bear Market, Insider Warns","The latest What Bitcoin Did episode, hosted by Danny Knowles, turns squarely to the question stalking one of the market’s hottest trades: can the boom in “Bitcoin treasury” companies withstand the next prolonged drawdown? Dylan LeClair, who helps lead the Bitcoin strategy at Tokyo-listed MetaPlanet, argues the answer rests less on ideology than on balance-sheet engineering, scale, and the willingness to endure volatility without blinking. “There’s sort of a ‘gradually then suddenly’ inflection point,” he said, describing how corporate exposure to Bitcoin has migrated from gimmick to boardroom agenda. The shift, in his view, is irreversible, but survival “is a constant fight with gravity” for firms that trade at premiums to their net asset value (NAV). Why Some Bitcoin Treasury Companies Won’t Survive The Bear Market LeClair’s thesis starts with market structure. Bitcoin is homogeneous collateral, but public equities are not. Liquidity, index inclusion, and the absolute size of a balance sheet produce a “winner-take-most dynamic,” he said. Even where two issuers have the same headline premium, the gravity of size changes the calculus: “Strategy is at a measly 1.8x premium, but the premium is like $50 billion of value,” he noted, contrasting that with the far smaller absolute premia attached to emerging players. Premiums compress mechanically as companies buy more Bitcoin or as the price rises, he added, which means maintaining a rich multiple demands ever-larger inflows of capital. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Pressed on what a bear market would do to those premia, LeClair separated cycle folklore from funding reality. He does not buy the inevitability of a 70% “pack it up for three years” drawdown as a base case, arguing the market now tends to reprice and then chop for extended periods. But he is unequivocal that a risk-off phase would punish sloppy balance sheets. “There will be pressure on MNAVs… Are you levered? With what sort of debt? Do you have secured debt where your Bitcoin’s encumbered? Do you have debt due in one year?” By contrast, he pointed to perpetual preferred equity—dividends but “no debt maturity ever”—as a structure that removes the most dangerous cliff: “With the prefs it’s like, no, we’re not selling actually ever.” For MetaPlanet, he framed risk management in deliberately dull terms: “We’re focused on staying… pristine, maintaining maximal flexibility.” He cited a “BTC rating” of roughly 16.5x—“we have 16 bucks of Bitcoin for every dollar of debt”—as intentional dry powder rather than under-optimization. The stress test, to him, is behavioral as much as financial: can management “eat the 70% bear market” if it comes? He expects casualties. “It’s naive to say that every company that adopts Bitcoin will be a success… there will be failures. There will be a bankruptcy… it’s a brutal, competitive world.” Where, then, is the moat? Not merely in being public, he argued, but in graduating from equity capital to the far deeper fixed-income markets. Convertibles provided early leverage—but at a cost he described with traderly bluntness. Convertible desks “woo you,” then short aggressively to hedge, “dampening the volatility” that many treasury companies actually want in their common stock. The more durable solution, he said, is permanent capital in the form of preferred equity. Here he credits Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with reaching “escape velocity,” pioneering a layered capital stack that now includes a new variable-rate preferred dubbed “Stretch” (ticker: STRC). Stretch is engineered to keep trading near $100 by adjusting its dividend and, if necessary, issuing new shares or calling them at $101—“a pretty genius feat of financial engineering,” in LeClair’s words, because it behaves like a cash-equivalent for investors without imposing maturity cliffs on the issuer. Strategy priced STRC in late July with an initial dividend framework and then closed a multi-billion-dollar offering, with the company describing the instrument as variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock designed to pay monthly and target trading near par. LeClair sees this as the practical realization of a long-standing ambition in crypto finance: a dollar-like instrument tied to Bitcoin collateral, without forcing asset sales in stress. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that were vulnerable to redemptions spirals, Strategy’s preferreds are senior to common equity and massively over-collateralized by transparent Bitcoin holdings, he argued. External observers have reached similar high-level descriptions: Strategy’s own materials emphasize STRC’s variable dividend on a stated $100 amount, while coverage in financial media notes the offering’s explicit aim to hew to par and its place alongside earlier preferreds (Stride, Strike, Strife) in a capital stack backed by tens of billions in unencumbered Bitcoin. All of this feeds the consolidation logic LeClair expects in a downturn. Preferreds, he said, are both offensive and defensive. Offensively, they add dry powder to buy more BTC or even buy back common if MNAV compresses, reversing flow against short sellers “playing this spread game.” Defensively, they function as an “MNAV defense mechanism,” easing reliance on converts and the gamma-trading that “neuters volatility” in the common. If markets turn, he anticipates classic Wall Street behavior: opportunists will “clear off some debt, buy the Bitcoin at a discount.” MetaPlanet, he added, is not seeking to be a roll-up; the focus is “laser” on BTC itself. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Market Sits Between Accumulation And Distribution Could Anyone Catch Strategy? LeClair is diplomatic on peers bringing large private Bitcoin pools public, calling it “overwhelmingly positive” for the asset. But his competitive assessment is stark: “I think Saylor’s reached escape velocity… a 600,000 Bitcoin lead is pretty insurmountable.” To contextualize that claim with public data, Strategy now reports roughly 629,000 BTC, giving it a commanding lead over other corporate holders. He adds that only a mega-cap with a decisive pivot—“if Mark Zuckerberg took the orange pill tomorrow”—could realistically challenge, which he deems unlikely given competing priorities like AI. LeClair is no maximalist about smooth sailing. Premiums will ebb. Funding windows will open and slam shut. Some firms, he warned, are “cosplaying as Bitcoiners” and may abandon discipline at the first whiff of pain. He was also frank about the sector’s self-selection bias: during the good times, new “treasury companies” appear by the week; the real filter arrives when prices fall and maturities near. “The times are good now… there will be a cycle. That’s what will separate the men from the boys,” he said. Survival, in his telling, comes down to a few non-negotiables: unencumbered collateral, long-dated or perpetual liabilities, and management that will not sell into downdrafts. Yet his broader message is that the game board has changed. Corporate adoption remains “early innings,” he said, because “the rest of the world actually simply doesn’t care” yet. The depth of the credit markets—and the emergence of Bitcoin-backed instruments palatable to those markets—may be what finally does the persuading. “If Bitcoin is going to eat the world… it has to get to all these different pools of capital.” Treasury companies that make that leap, he believes, can not only endure a bear market—they can use it to widen the gap. At press time, BTC traded at $118,100.

2025-07-31 20:00:00,49318724,1753992000,"Ethereum (ETH) Targets $7,000 After Bullish Signal, But This $0.035 Crypto Will Explode 10x First","Ethereum (ETH) is back in the headlines as bullish signals push price predictions toward $7,000 mark. But while the world’s second-largest crypto eyes its next rally, a smaller player is quietly stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising coin in the DeFi sector, has analysts buzzing as early indicators point to a potential 10x surge, outpacing even ETH’s momentum. Over 14,700 investors have already put their money in the project, with Mutuum Finance now having raised more than $13.8 million so far. The project is currently at Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, an increase of 16.67% from Presale Phase 5. The upcoming Phase 7 will also see a price increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Investors are now able to reap a 71.43% ROI when the token launches at $0.06. Ethereum Nears $4,000 While Eyes Turn Toward $7,000 Ethereum is trading around $3,876, holding above key support after a sharp rally from the low‑$3,000s. Institutional ETF inflows continue to pour in, surpassing $1.8B in the last week alone, sparking renewed confidence in ETH’s momentum regime around the critical $3,900–$4,100 resistance zone. Analysts now see potential targets ranging from $5,500 to $7,000 by Q3 or Q4 2025, backed by bullish on-chain data and growing staking and liquidity activity. That said, technical indicators such as RSI have entered overbought territory, suggesting the possibility of a short-term pullback toward $3,800–$3,700 before further upside gains. Meanwhile, interest is also growing in emerging DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance. Revolutionary Dual-Lending System by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an active and passive users’ lending platform in DeFi. Passive income is generated from lending USDT in stable passive income-generating smart contract pools. Aside from that, MUTM allows lenders and borrowers to swap as much as they want with no intermediaries. That is usually the case with members who use unstable assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Now Live with Growing Demand Following the complete sell-out of its Phase 5 presale, Mutuum Finance has brought online Phase 6 and the tokens are now priced at $0.035, which represents a rise of 16.17% from the previous round. The next price cap is $0.04, a 14.29% rise. Earliest investors at this level may realize a 71.43% return once MUTM is trading at $0.06. To date, the presale has raised over $13.8 million and attracted over 14,700 distinct investors, which speaks volumes about the project’s growing popularity. Secured by CertiK and a $50K Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Aside from that, the project is certified by CertiK with 95.0 trust score. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. It will reward on a four-severity scale: critical, major, minor and low. $100,000 in MUTM Tokens Available Mutuum Finance has started a $100,000 giveaway that will reward 10 winners with a total of $10,000 MUTM as gratitude for the investor’s initial trusting the project. Mutuum Finance’s momentum is undeniable, with over $13.8 million raised from more than 14,700 early investors and Phase 6 tokens moving quickly at $0.035. The next price jump to $0.04 represents a 14.29% increase, and early backers are positioned for a 71.43% ROI when MUTM launches at $0.06. Analysts predicting a 10x surge aren’t ignoring the numbers, demand is accelerating, the community is expanding, and the DeFi market is ripe for disruption.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the best-selling personal finance author says that investors should be foregoing stocks and bonds in favor of gold, silver, and Bitcoin ( BTC ) as US national debt continues to mount. According to Kiyosaki, even legendary billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have abandoned stocks and bonds. “Do you have a 401k or IRA filled with stocks? Do you know investment legends Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have sold most if not all of their stocks and bonds? They are both in cash or silver. If you do not know why Buffett and Rogers have sold their stocks and bonds you may want to find out. I sit tight with gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Good luck. We may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression. America’s debt is out of control. America is the world’s biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills… for so long.” In June, Kiyosaki said that he believes silver was undervalued and that it will be one of the assets investors flock to when the US stock and bond markets collapse. “The biggest bargain today is silver. In 2025, silver may 3x. The better news is silver is still 60% under all-time highs… still about $35… while gold and Bitcoin are at or near all-time highs… Silver is priced around $35 an ounce, which means almost everyone anywhere in the world… has a chance to grow richer… while millions grow poorer.” Earlier this month, he predicted that the top crypto asset by market cap could one day reach a staggering price tag of $1 million per token, and thus its current price is a bargain. BTC is trading for $118,080 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day, while silver is valued at $36.69 per ounce.

Details Here…,"After Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were approved in the US, the ETF process has begun for many altcoins such as XRP and Solana (SOL). While the SEC has not yet approved any altcoin ETFs other than Ethereum, two major US exchanges have applied to the SEC for simplified regulations for crypto ETF listings. Accordingly, the securities exchange Cboe BZX Exchange, along with NYSE Arca, filed a rule change with the SEC to ensure faster processing of cryptocurrency ETF listings, requesting changes for ETFs to speed up the transaction process. Exchanges have proposed allowing ETF issuers to list their products under a single framework, without having to apply for approval separately for each new cryptocurrency ETF. If approved, this could eliminate the need for separate approvals for each new fund and simplify the approval process. Experts said the proposal from Cboe and NYSE would eliminate the existing review process for exchange rule change applications for ETFs (19b-4) and allow ETFs that meet certain requirements to be automatically listed and traded without additional approval procedures. Under current regulations, exchanges must file Form 19b-4 for each new crypto ETF offering, leading to a lengthy and complex review process of up to 240 days. However, the proposed new framework could shorten this timeframe and simplify the process. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, said: “Cboe has filed a 19b-4 requesting a rule change that would allow crypto ETFs to be listed and traded under a standard framework. In other words, issuers would not need to seek special approval for each crypto ETF, as long as it meets certain criteria.” *This is not investment advice.

The asset is currently moving toward the upper bands of its two-week range-bound channel and could break out soon. “I think I’m wrong about ETH getting some short-term downside,” crypto analyst ‘Byzantine General’ told his 236,000 X followers on Wednesday. “It’s too strong and refuses to print any significant correction,” they added, noting that derivatives funding rates were going negative. Funding rates are periodic payments between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the underlying asset’s spot price. When funding rates go below baseline, it usually indicates bearish market sentiment as more traders are short than long, creating an imbalance, but this doesn’t seem to be happening with ETH.

Founder and CEO of ITC Crypto, Benjamin Cowen, zoomed out, noting the previous rejections at $4,000 in 2024 and saying that Ether needed to “go home” or crash back to bear market levels, which it did in April 2025. Now that the big dump has happened, ETH should break $4,000 this time around, he said. Cowen has predicted that the asset will trade in a realistic range of $5,700 to $7,500 for new all-time highs this cycle. Meanwhile, ‘Crypto GEMs’ predicted that ETH would reach $5,000 by the end of August. This month of the bull market year (the one after the Bitcoin halving) has been historically good for Ether.

They added that RSI is still not in overbought territory, the post-2021 all-time high breakout structure looks much healthier, and the downtrend has already been broken with a successful retest. The Ethereum community celebrated Ethereum’s 10th anniversary by ringing the closing bell at NASDAQ on Wednesday. “We worked to seed a new ecosystem and onboard TradFi to DeFi, with a mission to rebuild the global financial system. And together, we’re doing it,” said Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. ETH Price Outlook Ether has gained 1.2% on the day to reach $3,860 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session.

Atkins endorsed the PWG’s crypto policy proposals, describing them as the product of sustained inter-agency efforts and a critical step toward regulatory clarity. He emphasized that their efforts align with President Trump’s goal to make the United States the center of the global crypto economy . SEC’s Atkins says the PWG report will drive innovation and protect investors According to Atkins, the PWG report provides a balanced framework for digital asset oversight that encourages innovation, protects investors, and maintains the world-class standing of America’s financial markets. He explained that the framework would preserve market stability, encourage secure adoption, and enhance investor safeguards. He added that the SEC will continue to exercise its existing authority to create new rules and enforce any legislation passed by Congress. Atkins also acknowledged President Trump for his proactive stance on crypto, which was something he had seen was missing in the past administration. He commented, “Thank goodness President Trump does and is leading on it.” He also supported his colleagues, saying he would work with Commissioner Hester Peirce and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force to foster the crypto vision. The PWG report urges closer coordination between the SEC, CFTC, and other key federal agencies to establish a unified, transparent, and consistent regulatory approach. In line with the report’s recommendations, Atkins stated that they will develop innovative and durable regulatory policies that encourage growth in the sector and address potential risks. He noted that the US still needs to step up its efforts to stay ahead in the crypto revolution, saying he’s ready to do his part of the work. The Trump administration had asked regulators to act on the report’s recommendations On Wednesday, the Trump administration urged federal regulators to implement the report’s recommendations. In a fact sheet, the White House commented on the PWG report, saying, “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto.” It added that the report calls for the SEC and CFTC to act within their authority to facilitate federal-level trading of digital assets by setting clear rules on registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping. Additionally, per the fact sheet, the report requires regulators to ensure that new financial products can reach the market swiftly, without being held up by red tape. The report also pushes that the agencies clarify which bank functions are allowed in terms of stablecoins and blockchain technology, and for them to enhance disclosure around the process for obtaining bank charters. These recommendations come on the heels of President Trump signing the first-ever congressional legislation regulating stablecoins , a move hailed as a major victory for the crypto sector. The law outlines a framework for US dollar-backed stablecoins, which proponents say will encourage broader adoption of digital assets in mainstream finance, despite controversial views. Some lawmakers criticized the stablecoin framework, believing the president still has conflicts of interest.

2025-07-31 09:40:10,49292360,1753954810,Crucial Update: Binance RUNE Suspension for Essential THORChain Network Upgrade,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Update: Binance RUNE Suspension for Essential THORChain Network Upgrade In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about exchange announcements is crucial for every investor and trader. A significant development has just emerged concerning THORChain (RUNE) holders on Binance. The global crypto exchange giant, Binance, has announced a temporary Binance RUNE suspension of deposits and withdrawals for the THORChain network. This move, scheduled for July 31st, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, is in direct support of an upcoming, vital upgrade to the THORChain network. Understanding the implications of this suspension and what steps to take is paramount for ensuring your assets remain secure and accessible. Understanding the Binance RUNE Suspension : What’s Happening? Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently issued an official notice detailing its plans to halt all RUNE transactions on its platform. This isn’t an arbitrary decision but a standard procedure undertaken by exchanges to ensure the smooth and secure transition during significant blockchain network upgrades. The temporary Binance RUNE suspension specifically targets deposits and withdrawals of the THORChain network’s native token, RUNE. The announcement specifies that the suspension will commence precisely on July 31, 2024, at 17:00 UTC . While the exact duration of the suspension has not been explicitly stated beyond the commencement time, such halts typically last until the network upgrade is successfully completed and the network’s stability is verified. Users are advised to closely monitor Binance’s official announcements for updates regarding the resumption of services. Why do exchanges implement such measures? There are several key reasons: Data Integrity: To prevent any potential loss or corruption of user funds during the upgrade process, which often involves significant changes to the blockchain’s underlying architecture. Smooth Transition: To ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded on the new, upgraded chain, avoiding discrepancies or forks that could lead to confusion or financial losses. Security: Upgrades can sometimes expose temporary vulnerabilities. Suspending services minimizes the risk of exploitation during these critical periods. Compliance: Ensuring the exchange’s systems are fully compatible with the upgraded network’s protocols. This proactive step by Binance underscores its commitment to user security and the overall health of the THORChain ecosystem. It’s a testament to responsible exchange management, prioritizing the long-term stability of the assets it supports. What is THORChain (RUNE) and Why is This Upgrade Important? For those new to the space, THORChain (RUNE) stands as a groundbreaking decentralized liquidity protocol that enables seamless, non-custodial cross-chain swaps. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, THORChain allows users to exchange native cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and RUNE itself) directly between different blockchains without wrapping or bridging assets. This functionality is powered by its native utility token, RUNE, which is used for security, governance, and as a settlement asset within the network. Network upgrades are the lifeblood of any evolving blockchain project. They are essential for introducing new features, improving scalability, enhancing security, and fixing bugs. For THORChain, an upgrade can mean: Increased Efficiency: Faster transaction processing times and lower fees. Enhanced Security: Strengthening the network’s resilience against potential attacks. New Capabilities: Introduction of innovative functionalities that expand THORChain’s utility and appeal. Scalability Improvements: Preparing the network to handle a larger volume of transactions and users. While specific details of this particular THORChain upgrade have not been fully disclosed by Binance in their suspension notice, the very act of an exchange halting services for it signifies its importance. Such upgrades are critical for the long-term viability and competitiveness of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like THORChain. For RUNE holders, a successful upgrade typically translates to a more robust, secure, and valuable network, potentially leading to increased adoption and utility for their assets. Actionable Insights for RUNE Holders: What Should You Do Amidst the Binance RUNE Suspension ? If you hold RUNE on Binance or plan to interact with the THORChain network, this announcement requires your immediate attention. Here are some actionable steps and considerations: Avoid Transactions: Absolutely refrain from initiating any RUNE deposits or withdrawals on Binance from July 31, 2024, 17:00 UTC, until Binance officially announces the resumption of these services. Any attempts during this period may result in the loss of your funds or significant delays. Monitor Official Channels: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements page, their blog, and their social media channels for updates. This is the most reliable source of information regarding the status of the Binance RUNE suspension and the resumption of services. Plan Ahead: If you need to move your RUNE before the suspension, ensure you complete your transactions well in advance of the deadline. Consider the time zones carefully to avoid last-minute rushes. No Impact on Holdings: Your RUNE holdings on Binance will remain safe and unaffected during the suspension. This halt only pertains to the ability to move RUNE in or out of the exchange, not the security or value of your existing balance. Consider Alternatives (If Urgent): If you have an urgent need to interact with RUNE during the suspension period, you might explore other exchanges that support RUNE and have not announced a similar suspension, or consider self-custody solutions if you’re comfortable managing your own private keys. However, always exercise extreme caution and verify the legitimacy of any platform. Being proactive and informed is your best defense against potential issues during network upgrades. The temporary inconvenience of a Binance RUNE suspension is a small price to pay for the long-term health and security of the THORChain network. Navigating Future Crypto Exchange Updates: Best Practices The Binance RUNE suspension serves as a valuable reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Network upgrades, scheduled maintenance, and various other operational adjustments are common occurrences in this space. Developing a routine for staying informed can save you from unexpected surprises and potential losses. Here are some best practices for navigating future crypto exchange updates: Subscribe to Exchange Alerts: Most major exchanges offer email newsletters or notification services for important announcements. Sign up for these. Follow Official Social Media: Follow your preferred exchanges and the projects you invest in on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, or Discord. Be wary of unofficial accounts and always verify information. Regularly Check Announcement Pages: Make it a habit to periodically visit the official announcement sections of the exchanges you use. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just note the ‘what’ of an announcement; try to understand the ‘why’. Knowing the reason behind a suspension or upgrade helps you assess its impact and importance. Diversify (Where Prudent): While not always feasible for every asset, having funds spread across different secure platforms can sometimes offer flexibility during specific exchange-related events. By adopting these habits, you empower yourself to react swiftly and appropriately to any changes, ensuring your crypto journey remains as smooth and secure as possible. In conclusion, the temporary Binance RUNE suspension for deposits and withdrawals, effective July 31, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, is a necessary measure in support of an upcoming THORChain network upgrade. While it requires users to adjust their transaction plans, it is ultimately a positive sign of a healthy, evolving blockchain ecosystem and a responsible exchange. By staying informed, planning ahead, and understanding the reasons behind such actions, RUNE holders can navigate this period with confidence, looking forward to a stronger and more efficient THORChain network post-upgrade.

2025-07-31 09:37:48,49295179,1753954668,Bitcoin may end consolidation phase and break above $120k,"The cryptocurrency market has been consolidating over the last few days, but could experience a breakout soon. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has been trading between the $115k-$120k region over the last two weeks. However, BTC could be gearing up for a breakout that would allow it to hit a new all-time high soon. BTC recovers above $118k as Fed keeps rate unchanged Bitcoin has had a volatile 24 hours following the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the apex bank is keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged . The decision marks a continuation of the Fed’s “wait-and-see” strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of tariffs on inflation. However, the major impact on Bitcoin’s price was Powell’s speech. The Fed chair stated that there are several economic releases before the September FOMC meeting, including two months of data on employment and inflation. Hence, there is no certainty of a rate cut in September. He added that, “We’ll be taking that information into consideration and all the other information we get as we make our decision at the September meeting. If the risks to the two mandates were more in balance, that would imply that policy shouldn’t be restrictive – hence the bar for a rate cut is not necessarily high.” This speech saw Bitcoin’s price tank to the $116k level within minutes, with altcoins also recording huge losses. The dump also saw over $200 million in long positions liquidated within an hour. BTC recovers above $118k, targets breakout above $120k The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bearish as Bitcoin recovers above $118k. The leading cryptocurrency has been consolidating over the past few weeks, but could be set for a breakout soon. Currently, Bitcoin is forming a dynamic support around the $117k level that could allow it to break out and set a new all-time high in the process. This structure coincides with prior supply zones in the $120,000–$121,600 range. The technical indicators currently paint a mixed picture as BTC is still consolidating. The Parabolic SAR dots remain above the candles, hinting at potential trend weakness. In addition to that, Bollinger Bands have tightened between $117,317 and $119,393, suggesting extreme volatility ahead. BTC is currently caught between the 20 EMA at $118,150 and the 100 EMA at $117,159, with neither the bulls nor bears in control of the market. However, the MACD is not fluctuating much, and the RSI of 53 shows that buying pressure might resume soon. A mini breakout above the $118,700 level could see BTC test the $120,500 resistance point over the next few hours. An extended rally would allow it to set a new all-time high price above $124k. However, a dip below the $117k support could see BTC tumble back to $114,600 or even test levels around $110,000.

2025-07-31 09:35:10,49292196,1753954510,Explosive Altcoin Market: Futures Trading Volume Surges to Five-Month High,"BitcoinWorld Explosive Altcoin Market: Futures Trading Volume Surges to Five-Month High Are you feeling the buzz in the cryptocurrency world? If so, you’re not alone. The digital asset space is currently witnessing a phenomenal shift, with the altcoin market taking center stage. Following Bitcoin’s impressive rally to around $120,000, it appears that the spotlight has firmly turned towards alternative cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a wave, with on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reporting a significant surge in trading activity, particularly within the perpetual futures segment. What’s Fueling the Altcoin Market Frenzy? The latest data from CryptoQuant, shared on X, paints a compelling picture: altcoins are gaining substantial momentum. This isn’t just anecdotal observation; the numbers speak volumes. Trading activity in the altcoin market , especially in perpetual futures contracts, has seen a remarkable uptick. But what exactly does this surge entail, and why is it so significant? The combined trading volume for Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoin perpetual contracts has soared to an astonishing $223.6 billion. To put this into perspective, this figure represents the highest volume recorded in five months. Even more striking is that this massive volume now constitutes 83% of the total trading volume across centralized exchanges. This dominance clearly indicates a shift in trader focus and capital allocation. Bitcoin’s Precedent: Bitcoin’s strong performance often acts as a catalyst, pulling the broader crypto market, including altcoins, upwards. Its recent surge has instilled confidence, prompting traders to explore higher-beta assets. Search for Alpha: After Bitcoin’s initial run, many traders look to altcoins for potentially larger percentage gains, leveraging their inherent volatility. Narrative-Driven Cycles: Specific narratives within the altcoin space, such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Real World Assets (RWAs), can ignite significant interest and trading volume in related projects. Why Are Perpetual Futures So Important for the Altcoin Market? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous speculation. Their surge in the altcoin market signifies several key trends: Increased Speculation: A high volume in perpetual futures indicates aggressive speculative activity. Traders are actively taking leveraged positions, betting on significant price movements in altcoins. Enhanced Liquidity: The influx of trading volume provides deeper liquidity to the altcoin futures market, making it easier for large orders to be executed without significant price slippage. Broader Participation: The accessibility of perpetual futures on centralized exchanges attracts a wide range of participants, from retail traders to institutional players, all seeking to capitalize on altcoin volatility. Market Sentiment Indicator: High open interest and trading volume in perpetual futures can be a strong indicator of bullish sentiment, as traders are willing to take on more risk for potential gains. Conversely, a sudden drop could signal a shift in sentiment. Is This Sustainable? Understanding the Benefits and Challenges of the Altcoin Market Boom The current momentum in the altcoin market presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic environment. Benefits: High Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially smaller cap projects, can offer exponential returns compared to more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Diversification: Investing in a diversified portfolio of altcoins can help spread risk and capture growth from various sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins represent the cutting edge of blockchain technology, offering exposure to new applications, protocols, and use cases that could revolutionize various industries. Challenges: Extreme Volatility: While offering high returns, altcoins are notoriously volatile. Prices can swing wildly, leading to significant gains or losses in short periods. Liquidation Risk (in Futures): Trading perpetual futures involves leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses. Incorrect predictions can lead to rapid liquidations, wiping out an entire position. Rug Pulls and Scams: The altcoin space, particularly newer or lesser-known projects, is susceptible to scams and ‘rug pulls,’ where developers abandon a project and disappear with investor funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies can impact altcoin projects, potentially leading to delistings or operational challenges. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Altcoin Market with Confidence Given the current fervor, how can you approach the altcoin market responsibly? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Thoroughly research any altcoin project you consider. Look into its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, community, and tokenomics. Understand Leverage: If you engage in futures trading, understand how leverage works. Start with low leverage and only use what you can afford to lose. Implement robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across several promising altcoins in different sectors to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Platforms like CryptoQuant provide valuable on-chain data that can offer insights. Start Small: Especially if you’re new to altcoins or futures trading, begin with smaller amounts to gain experience and understand the market dynamics before committing significant capital. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether you are a long-term investor or a short-term trader. This will influence your strategy and risk tolerance. The surge in altcoin futures trading volume is a clear signal that market participants are increasingly confident about the potential of alternative cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is not merely a consequence of Bitcoin’s rally but also reflects growing interest in the innovative solutions and high growth potential that altcoins offer. However, with great opportunity comes great responsibility. The volatility and inherent risks of the altcoin market demand a cautious yet informed approach. By prioritizing research, understanding risk management, and staying disciplined, investors and traders can better position themselves to navigate this exciting, albeit challenging, landscape. The coming months will undoubtedly be crucial for the altcoin market . Whether this surge leads to sustained growth or a period of consolidation, one thing is clear: altcoins are here to stay, and their influence on the broader crypto ecosystem is only set to grow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Altcoin Market Surge Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract in crypto? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they can be held indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. They are popular for leveraged trading, allowing traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. Q2: Why is the surge in altcoin perpetual futures volume significant? A significant surge in altcoin perpetual futures volume indicates heightened speculative interest and increased liquidity in the altcoin market. It suggests that traders are actively taking leveraged positions, expecting substantial price movements, and reflects a strong bullish sentiment towards altcoins. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s price affect the altcoin market? Bitcoin’s price often acts as a bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin performs well, it typically instills confidence, leading capital to flow into altcoins as traders seek higher percentage gains. Conversely, a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price can trigger a sell-off across the altcoin market. Q4: What are the main risks of trading altcoin futures? The primary risks include high volatility, which can lead to rapid and significant losses, especially when using leverage. There’s also the risk of liquidation, where your position is automatically closed if the market moves against you and your margin falls below a certain level. Additionally, market manipulation and the inherent risks of specific altcoin projects are concerns. Q5: How can I protect myself when investing in altcoins? To protect yourself, always conduct thorough research (DYOR) on any project. Understand its fundamentals, team, and technology. Implement strict risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and only risking a small percentage of your portfolio on any single trade. Diversify your investments across multiple altcoins and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Did you find this article insightful?

2025-07-31 09:34:08,49295871,1753954448,"Shiba Inu Was Big in 2021, But This Under-$0.003 Coin Will Create 5x More Millionaires Than SHIB in 2025","Back in 2021, some people turned a few hundred bucks into thousands. Others became full-on millionaires. For a while, SHIB ruled the meme coin space. But in 2025, that crown may not belong to Shiba Inu anymore. A new name is making noise—not just hype, but with real numbers and serious momentum. That name is LILPEPE, and at under $0.003 per token, it’s quietly building up to outperform SHIB in every way imaginable. Analysts are even predicting a 98,476% rise in the next 7 months, and with over $12.5 million raised so far in its presale, the buzz is turning into something much bigger. For those who missed the SHIB wave or sold too early, LILPEPE offers a second shot worth paying attention to. Shiba Inu Took Off in 2021 — But Times Have Changed When SHIB started blowing up, no one took it seriously. It was just another meme coin with a funny name. But something happened. It got picked up on TikTok, Elon Musk tweeted about Dogecoin, and the market started rewarding memes more than fundamentals. In that wild wave, SHIB saw its market cap rocket, creating tons of millionaires almost overnight. But here’s the thing—SHIB had no real utility when it started. It was all community, all hype. And while that worked back then, 2025 is a different beast. Investors are smarter now. Meme coins need more than a catchy name—they need a product, a plan, and real potential for growth. Why LILPEPE Is Built Different LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin trying to copy the past. It’s built on a next-gen Ethereum Layer-2 chain, giving it faster speeds, lower gas fees, and better scalability. More importantly, it’s doing this with zero transaction tax, something SHIB holders never had. The team behind LILPEPE has also laid out a clear roadmap that includes staking, DEX integration, major exchange listings, and even an NFT ecosystem. But the real kicker? LILPEPE is still in its presale, and people are already cashing in. The presale is currently in Stage 8, priced at just $0.0017. That’s already a 70% increase from Stage 1, where the earliest buyers picked it up at $0.0010. Yet even at this stage, investors have a clear 76.4% gain potential if the token hits its projected launch price of $0.0030. LILPEPE just got listed on CoinMarketCap to make things more exciting, giving it more exposure and credibility. That’s a move SHIB didn’t make until much later in its journey. Presale Is Almost Sold Out — And The Next Jump Is Imminent As of right now, Stage 8 is 92.67% filled. The total funds raised have already crossed $12.5 million, and once the final tokens in this stage are sold, the price will automatically jump to $0.0018 in Stage 9. That’s another 10% gain, gone in an instant. This kind of fast-moving presale pressure is what drives FOMO. And with only 15 stages in total, the window to buy LILPEPE under $0.002 is closing faster than most people realize. If you think it’s just hype, consider this: early SHIB holders saw massive gains because they bought before the noise. LILPEPE is still before the noise, but it’s making all the right moves—getting listed on major platforms, trending on social media, and building a real utility on top of its meme appeal. Final Thoughts — Don’t Miss This One LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin with a funny frog face. It’s a full-blown crypto project with serious upside, a clear roadmap, and one of the most active presales of 2025. At the moment, the coin is trading at $0.0017 and is expected to reach $0.0030 upon launch. This coin is truly at the beginning of its explosive growth. Everyone remembers the news concerning Shiba Inu back in 2021. But in 2025, LILPEPE could make history. With the potential for a 98,476% rise and five times the millionaire-making momentum of SHIB, now might be the best time to get in before the rest of the world wakes up to what’s coming. You can join the presale and see all the details at littlepepe.com . If you feel the energy and want to be part of the next big crypto story, now’s your chance. Before Stage 9 hits—before the price jumps again—make your move.

2025-07-31 09:30:11,49291910,1753954211,Bitcoin Investment: ANAP Holdings’ Bold Move into Crypto,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: ANAP Holdings’ Bold Move into Crypto Imagine your favorite fashion brand making significant moves in the digital asset space. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s today’s reality. Japanese fashion powerhouse ANAP Holdings has once again turned heads in the financial world with its latest Bitcoin investment , signaling growing confidence among traditional businesses in the decentralized future. ANAP Holdings’ Strategic Bitcoin Investment: A Fashion Statement? Japanese fashion brand ANAP Holdings recently announced another substantial acquisition of Bitcoin, adding 16.9786 BTC to its reserves. This elevates ANAP’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 831.1191 BTC. For a company known for trendy apparel, this consistent accumulation speaks volumes about its long-term vision and belief in digital assets. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the Bitcoin market. The company has steadily built its crypto treasury, with a clear ambition to acquire over 1,000 BTC by August. This aggressive target highlights a profound commitment to Bitcoin as a core component of their financial strategy, moving beyond traditional fiat assets. What compels a fashion brand to make such a significant Bitcoin investment ? It’s a tangible example of how companies view Bitcoin not merely as speculative, but as a legitimate store of value and a strategic hedge against economic uncertainties. Why Are Companies Like ANAP Making a Bitcoin Investment? Traditional corporate treasury strategies are evolving. Factors like inflation, negative real interest rates, and geopolitical instability push companies to explore alternatives. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing institutional acceptance, offers a compelling option. Key reasons for a substantial Bitcoin investment : Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s capped supply (21 million coins) makes it an attractive hedge against inflation and currency debasement, preserving purchasing power. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin shows significant long-term growth. Companies aim for substantial returns on idle cash. Diversification: Bitcoin diversifies a treasury portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk by adding an uncorrelated asset class. Technological Alignment: Investing in Bitcoin signals innovation, enhancing brand image and appealing to tech-savvy consumers. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: What Are the Risks? While benefits are compelling, corporate Bitcoin investment has challenges. Companies must carefully weigh these factors: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s swings offer opportunities but also risks of substantial losses, impacting financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulations across jurisdictions can affect legality, tax treatment, or operations. Security Concerns: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security to prevent hacks or loss of keys. Accounting Complexities: Bitcoin’s intangible asset classification can lead to non-cash impairment charges if prices drop. ANAP’s steady increase suggests they manage these risks, viewing them as acceptable trade-offs for long-term benefits. Pioneers of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: Who Else is Leading the Charge? ANAP Holdings joins a growing cohort of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, famously spearheaded this trend, adopting Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset. Other notable examples include: Tesla: The EV giant made a significant Bitcoin investment in early 2021, legitimizing Bitcoin for many mainstream investors. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company not only holds Bitcoin but integrates it into Cash App, allowing users to buy, sell, and store it. These pioneers demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits for companies of various sizes and industries to incorporate Bitcoin. ANAP’s entry from the fashion sector broadens this corporate trend’s appeal. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: What Does ANAP’s Move Signify? ANAP’s ambitious Bitcoin investment strategy is a powerful signal. It suggests corporate adoption of digital assets is a fundamental shift in how businesses manage financial resources. As more companies see benefits and ecosystem maturity, a snowball effect is possible. This trend could lead to: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: Companies embracing Bitcoin normalize its status, reducing skepticism. New Financial Products: Corporate demand will spur innovation in traditional finance. Greater Regulatory Clarity: Growing corporate adoption compels clearer government guidelines. ANAP’s commitment to 1,000 BTC by August is a bold statement. It shows conviction that Bitcoin is a viable, strategic asset for established businesses to future-proof their balance sheets in an unpredictable global economy. Conclusion: Fashioning a Future with Bitcoin ANAP Holdings’ expanding Bitcoin investment portfolio is a compelling narrative in corporate digital asset adoption. It shows a forward-thinking approach to treasury management, recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as an inflation hedge, value driver, and innovation symbol. While challenges persist, companies like ANAP pave the way, proving that strategic Bitcoin allocation can be a viable and lucrative part of modern corporate financial strategy. As traditional finance and digital economy blur, ANAP’s journey offers a glimpse into the future of corporate treasury, where even fashion brands make bold statements in decentralized finance.

2025-07-31 09:27:14,49291794,1753954034,"Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) Set to Soar in Q3, but This Under-$0.002 Token Might Deliver the Biggest Gains This Cycle","The crypto market hit a new peak in the past week, reaching $4 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are among the top gainers. Institutional interest, new developments, and a bullish market mood drive both assets' surge. However, while ETH and ADA are expected to maintain their resurgence in Q3, a relatively unknown meme-based project priced under $0.002 quietly stirs up FOMO. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , a Layer 2 meme-centric blockchain, is gaining traction for all the right reasons. Could this be the surprise winner of the cycle? Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Poised for a Historic Breakout Ethereum is no stranger to market cycles, but Q3 2025 is shaping up to be special. Over the past three months, ETH has surged over 150%, fueled by overwhelming inflows into Ethereum ETFs, massive corporate accumulation, and a looming supply crunch. Ethereum ETFs saw $296.5 million in net inflows in the past day, marking 12 consecutive days of capital injection from institutional investors. The momentum is also visible at the blockchain level. One wallet bought over $397 million in ETH as Ethereum whales picked up 150,000 ETH in four days. These accumulating trends show a long-term conviction in Ethereum's future as a credible store of wealth and the decentralized network's backbone. Ethereum Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Moreover, the recent passage of the GENUIS Act is expected to spark a broader crypto rally. Analysts expect ETH's inclusion in more government-backed portfolios and an expanded role in treasuries. The market has already responded positively to the debut of the Pectra upgrade. With clear legislation now underway, ETH might be the star of this crypto cycle. As of this report, ETH hovers near $3,700 and is eyeing resistance levels around $4,100. A decisive breakout could send it well past the $10,000 mark this quarter. Cardano (ADA) Gains Traction With Apple Integration & Whale Interest Cardano has also carved out its bullish path with key ecosystem integrations and a surge in community interest. ADA is currently one of the top-performing assets in the top 10, posting an impressive 30-day gain of 62%. It’s rapidly approaching the symbolic $1 level, and momentum doesn’t seem to be slowing. Cardano Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Cardano's recent highlight includes the integration of CardanoKit , a native Swift library that allows for ADA support in the iOS ecosystem. This potentially paves the way for Apple Pay compatibility, opening Cardano to millions of iPhone users and adding serious utility to the token's value proposition. Meanwhile, whale activity has exploded. ADA open interest in futures surged to a record high of $1.7 billion, surpassing its 2021 peak. Trading volumes have followed suit, and investor sentiment has flipped fully bullish, with the Fear and Greed Index at 67.

2025-07-31 09:23:03,49293218,1753953783,"Ether Machine adds 15,000 ETH, becomes the 3rd largest corporate holder of Ethereum","The Ether Machine has become the third-largest corporate holder of Ethereum after its latest acquisition of 15,000 ETH. Celebrating Ethereum’s 10-year anniversary, the company added $56.9 million worth of ETH on July 30 at an average price of $3,809.97 per token. The purchase brings The Ether Machine’s total holdings to 334,757 ETH, cementing its position among the top firms accumulating Ethereum as a long-term strategic asset. The latest acquisition was executed through The Ether Reserve LLC, the firm’s dedicated treasury arm. According to the company, the purchase was funded from a $97 million private placement and marks the start of its broader treasury deployment. As of now, the Ether Reserve still holds $407 million in cash reserves earmarked for additional ETH purchases shortly. “We couldn’t imagine a better way to commemorate Ethereum’s 10th birthday than by deepening our commitment to ether,” co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys said in the press release. “We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term — not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.” Nasdaq listing on the horizon Ether Machine was formed through a business combination between The Ether Reserve and Nasdaq-listed Dynamix Corporation earlier this year. The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals, will see the merged entity go public under the ticker symbol “ETHM.” The transaction includes over $1.5 billion in fully committed capital, anchored by a $645 million Ethereum contribution from Keys. An additional $800 million in equity commitments has been secured from a consortium of institutional backers, including Kraken, Pantera Capital, Blockchain.com, Electric Capital, Archetype, and 1Roundtable/10T Holdings. Upon listing, ETHM is expected to debut with the largest Ethereum treasury of any publicly traded company. Its core strategy centres on generating ETH-denominated yield through staking, restaking, and structured DeFi participation, a model that’s fast becoming a staple among companies adopting an Ethereum treasury strategy. When operational, Ether Machine also plans to offer Ethereum-native infrastructure services to institutional clients, DAOs, and developers, including validator node operations and custom block-building tools. Corporate race for ETH intensifies Over the past few months, Ethereum seems to have become the new coveted treasury asset , mostly due to its passive yield potential through staking and its central role in powering decentralised finance and tokenised real-world assets. Experts at Standard Chartered have reported that public companies have already acquired 1% of Ethereum’s circulating supply since June, and the total corporate holdings now exceed 1.26 million ETH. The bank estimates this figure could rise tenfold in the coming years. It’s not just new capital that’s flowing into Ethereum; companies from outside the crypto sector are also pivoting toward ETH as they rethink their treasury strategies. One of the boldest examples is Nasdaq-listed 180 Life Sciences, which recently announced plans to exit biotech entirely and rebrand as ETHZilla. Another new entrant, FG Nexus — formerly Fundamental Global — is also pivoting to Ethereum. The firm launched a $200 million raise to fund ETH acquisitions. Among existing players, SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion Technologies remain at the forefront of corporate ETH accumulation. SharpLink , often dubbed the “MicroStrategy for Ethereum,” recently expanded its holdings to 438,190 ETH; however, BitMIne currently leads the pack with over 625,000 Ether in its reserves as per data from StrategicETHReserve.

2025-07-31 09:19:30,49293216,1753953570,"Analysts say this could be the Solana of 2025, but it’s still under $0.04","According to their latest projection, MUTM could climb to over $2 before 2026, setting the stage for a possible 5,614% return from today’s price of just $0.035. Even without future forecasts, the current setup is impressive. Investors entering at Phase 6 are already positioned for nearly 6x returns at the public listing price of $0.06. But those who wait may end up buying closer to the top, while early-phase participants from Phase 1 (at $0.01) are already looking at 3.5x gains on paper. With a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens and increasing presale demand, this token is starting to look like more than just another DeFi play — it’s shaping up to be a next-generation ecosystem for lending, stablecoins, and passive income. P2C lending is building to deliver passive rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a permissionless and non-custodial Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending model designed to attract both conservative and capital-efficient investors. In this system, users will be able to deposit assets like ETH, USDT, or other blue-chip tokens into a shared liquidity pool. The protocol will then allocate these funds to overcollateralized borrowers, with APYs adjusting dynamically based on pool utilization. For example, a user depositing $20,000 worth of ETH will be able to earn around 9.4% APY—automatically paid as interest accrues within the smart contract. Borrowers, in turn, will unlock up to 70% Loan-to-Value (LTV) against the same $20,000 in ETH, enabling access to $14,000 in stablecoins without needing to sell their underlying asset. All loans will remain overcollateralized, reducing protocol-level risk while enabling flexible, instant lending. Alongside this, the platform will also support Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for users seeking tailored agreements. In the P2P model, borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, often involving volatile tokens like memcoins or specific loan durations. This option will cater to traders and advanced users looking for custom opportunities, while the P2C model will serve those prioritizing automated, risk-adjusted yield on high-quality assets. Stablecoin engine with peg protection and smart minting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just building a lending network—it’s architecting a full decentralized finance backbone, starting with its stablecoin system. The native stablecoin will only be minted when loans are issued and will be destroyed immediately upon repayment or liquidation. This controlled mint-burn mechanism ensures strict supply control and helps avoid the inflationary pitfalls seen in many algorithmic stablecoin designs. Interest rates on borrowing will be governed at the protocol level. For example, if the stablecoin dips below its $1 peg, borrowing interest rates may be adjusted upward to shrink supply and restore equilibrium. Minting privileges are restricted to pre-approved smart contracts that enforce strict overcollateralization, ensuring all loans backed by the stablecoin remain safe and trustless. By building this system directly into the protocol’s architecture, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to offer a stable, scalable DeFi experience while enabling cross-platform interoperability through its upcoming Layer-2 deployment, drastically reducing gas fees and enhancing throughput. Phase 6 presale is heating up — time to get in Right now, Phase 6 of the presale is live with MUTM priced at $0.035, and already 7% of the 170 million Phase 6 tokens have been sold. Over 14,700 holders have already joined, contributing more than $13.70 million to the presale round. The next price jump is locked in at $0.040 in Phase 7—a 15% increase from the current rate, making this phase a critical window for entry before prices surge again. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rewarding early supporters with a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. And to reinforce platform security and trust, the protocol has launched a $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK, achieving a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00, reflecting high audit reliability. The project’s Twitter following has already crossed 12,000 users, pointing to a growing and active community base. With public launch around the corner and listing set at $0.06, investors entering now are front-running what might become one of 2025’s most celebrated DeFi breakouts. The momentum is building—and so is the price. Don’t miss the next Solana-like surge The window to buy MUTM under $0.04 is closing fast. With the analyst forecast targeting $2+ by 2026, the 57x return potential is already catching the attention of seasoned whales. Those who watched Solana (SOL) soar from obscurity into the top 10 are now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big opportunity. This isn’t about hype—it’s about timing. And in crypto, timing is everything.

Most altcoins are also in the green today, with ETH climbing back toward $3,900 and ENA exploding by double digits once more. BTC Recovers After FOMC Meeting After the correction at the end of the previous business week, which drove BTC to a 14-day low of under $114,500, the primary cryptocurrency managed to recover most losses and even headed toward $120,000 at the beginning of the current one. However, the resistance at that level turned out to be too strong for bitcoin’s current momentum, and the asset returned to around $118,000 yesterday ahead of the latest FOMC meeting for the year. All eyes turned to the US central bank, especially after the country’s GDP report for Q2 was significantly higher than expected. However, the Fed refused to change the interest rates, which resulted in some volatility for BTC. Perhaps also driven by the lack of any mention of a strategic bitcoin reserve in the White House’s digital asset report , which went live yesterday as well, the cryptocurrency dropped by several grand to below $116,000. Nevertheless, it has recovered most losses and challenged $119,000 earlier today. As of now, it remains about $500 away from that level, while its market cap has risen to $2.360 trillion.

2025-07-31 09:17:26,49291389,1753953446,Bolivia Calls Crypto ‘Reliable Alternative’ in New El Salvador Partnership Deal,"Bolivia’s Central Bank has signed a memorandum of understanding with El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets to promote crypto development, marking a dramatic policy reversal for a nation that previously banned virtual assets and now calls them a “ reliable alternative ” to traditional currencies. The cooperation agreement enables mutual information exchange and knowledge sharing on blockchain intelligence tools, risk analysis, and regulatory experiences between both institutions. Source: Press Release Bolivia’s Virtual Asset Usage Explodes 532% in One Year Bolivia’s virtual asset usage surged from $46.5 million to $294 million between June 2024 and June 2025 following regulatory changes. Source: Reuters The partnership comes into effect immediately for an indefinite period. This positions Bolivia to benefit from El Salvador’s pioneering regulatory framework and practical experience as the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador’s CNAD has become a fundamental actor in the global digital assets ecosystem. Bolivia’s embrace of cryptocurrency contrasts sharply with its historical stance, having previously maintained strict prohibitions on virtual assets before implementing Board Resolution 082/2024 in June 2024. The policy shift enables legal use of virtual assets for cross-border transactions and e-commerce payments. The agreement consolidates progress made in establishing digital assets as viable alternatives for families and small entrepreneurs. At the same time, Bolivia’s Central Bank commits to developing policies that modernize the financial system and deepen financial inclusion through regulated cryptocurrency ecosystems. El Salvador’s experience provides valuable guidance despite recent International Monetary Fund restrictions that have capped the country’s Bitcoin purchases and mandated privatization of the state-run Chivo wallet by July 2025. Bolivia’s Cryptocurrency Revolution Gains Momentum Earlier this year, the Central Bank of Bolivia authorized state oil company YPFB to use cryptocurrency for purchasing crude oil and diesel from international vendors in March 2025. They aimed to address foreign currency shortages that created fuel supply disruptions across the country. President Luis Arce’s cabinet granted YPFB permission to conduct fuel import deals using either USD or cryptocurrency, with Bolivia requiring at least $60 million weekly for fuel imports. The decree instructs YPFB to make budgetary adjustments covering financial costs within applicable regulations. Bolivia’s cryptocurrency adoption has accelerated rapidly, with virtual asset transactions exceeding 1.1 million from July to September 2024 , compared to 932,000 in the six months before then. Six financial institutions began operating with virtual assets, reporting 40% growth in operations between July and August. The Central Bank launched educational initiatives, conducting over 33 workshops nationwide, reaching more than 3,000 participants to inform the public about virtual asset characteristics and risks. The legal framework enables Bolivians to use cryptocurrency for cross-border transactions and e-commerce payments. The partnership with El Salvador provides technical expertise for developing secure and regulated cryptocurrency ecosystems. Source: Press Release Bolivia joins a growing number of countries using cryptocurrency for international trade, particularly those seeking alternatives to traditional banking systems amid sanctions or political tensions. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Model Faces IMF Constraints El Salvador maintains approximately 6,244 Bitcoin worth $742 million despite IMF loan agreement restrictions preventing new government purchases since February 2025. The $1.4 billion loan program requires the country to maintain unchanged Bitcoin holdings and privatize the Chivo wallet. President Nayib Bukele’s previous claims of daily Bitcoin purchases have been contradicted by IMF documentation confirming no new acquisitions since the loan agreement. On-chain activity showing Bitcoin movements between wallets represents internal transfers rather than fresh purchases. The IMF praised El Salvador’s updated Bitcoin policy for reducing fiscal risk and strengthening transparency, noting these steps help stabilize inflation and restore macroeconomic stability. However, Bitcoin is no longer considered mandatory legal tender under the agreement. El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment appears to be faltering under the weight of an IMF loan agreement and declining public engagement. #IMF #ElSalvador https://t.co/65lADRixOH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 26, 2025 El Salvador’s CNAD has consolidated its position as a regional leader in cryptocurrency regulation, promoting innovation, security, and regulatory compliance throughout the digital assets sector. The country’s regulatory framework remains among the most developed and advanced in promoting virtual assets globally. The My First Bitcoin organization reported that government-backed education and adoption efforts have stalled since the IMF deal , with declining public engagement in cryptocurrency learning programs. The shift has raised questions about the long-term viability of El Salvador’s original Bitcoin vision.

2025-07-31 09:15:10,49291256,1753953310,Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Reign: Why Pompliano Crowns It ‘King of Wall Street’,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Reign: Why Pompliano Crowns It ‘King of Wall Street’ In the dynamic world of finance, few assets command attention quite like Bitcoin . What was once considered a niche digital curiosity has undeniably ascended to the forefront of investment conversations, captivating both individual enthusiasts and institutional giants alike. Recently, a powerful declaration from a prominent voice in the crypto space has echoed across financial markets, solidifying Bitcoin’s burgeoning status. Anthony Pompliano, the insightful founder and CEO of ProCapBTC, didn’t mince words during a recent CNBC interview, boldly proclaiming that Bitcoin has transitioned from a fringe investment into a widely embraced asset, unequivocally calling it “the king of Wall Street.” This isn’t just hyperbole; it’s a reflection of a profound shift in how the financial world perceives and integrates the leading cryptocurrency. The Coronation: Why Bitcoin is ‘King of Wall Street’ Pompliano’s pronouncement isn’t made in a vacuum. It stems from a meticulous observation of market trends and economic shifts that highlight Bitcoin’s superior performance and increasing relevance. His argument is multi-faceted, drawing on critical comparisons with traditional financial benchmarks. The essence of his claim lies in Bitcoin’s remarkable resilience and appreciation, especially when contrasted with the weakening purchasing power of fiat currencies and the underperformance of conventional equities. Erosion of Fiat Purchasing Power: One of Pompliano’s key points, as highlighted by Wu Blockchain, is the significant decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power. Over the past five years, the dollar has reportedly seen a roughly 30% reduction in its value. This erosion means that holding traditional cash assets has resulted in a substantial loss of wealth over time, making a compelling case for alternative stores of value. S&P 500’s Underperformance Against Bitcoin: Perhaps even more striking is the comparison between the S&P 500, a cornerstone of traditional investment, and Bitcoin. Since 2020, the S&P 500 has plummeted by more than 85% when its performance is measured in Bitcoin. This stark contrast underscores Bitcoin’s exponential growth and its potential as a superior long-term investment, outshining even the most robust stock market indices. Institutional Embrace: The ‘king’ status isn’t just about performance; it’s about acceptance. Wall Street, once skeptical, is now actively integrating Bitcoin. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has opened floodgates for institutional capital, providing regulated and accessible avenues for major players to gain exposure to the digital asset. Decoding the Institutional Embrace: Who’s Adopting Bitcoin and Why? The journey of Bitcoin from a fringe asset to a Wall Street darling is largely attributed to the growing institutional embrace. This isn’t a sudden phenomenon but a gradual recognition of Bitcoin’s unique attributes and its role in a diversified portfolio. But who exactly is adopting Bitcoin, and what are their motivations? Major Players Entering the Bitcoin Arena: The list of institutions exploring or directly investing in Bitcoin is growing. This includes: Asset Managers: Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have launched Bitcoin ETFs, allowing their vast client bases to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Publicly Traded Corporations: Companies like MicroStrategy have made significant Bitcoin acquisitions, integrating it into their treasury reserves as a hedge against inflation and a growth asset. Hedge Funds and Family Offices: These sophisticated investors are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, seeking diversification and asymmetric returns. Payment Processors: Companies like PayPal and Square (Block Inc.) have integrated Bitcoin into their services, making it more accessible for everyday transactions and investment. What are the Driving Forces Behind This Bitcoin Adoption? Several factors are propelling this institutional shift towards Bitcoin: Factor Explanation Inflation Hedge With unprecedented monetary easing and rising inflation concerns globally, institutions view Bitcoin’s finite supply (21 million coins) as a robust hedge against currency debasement, much like digital gold. Digital Gold Narrative Bitcoin shares characteristics with gold – scarcity, divisibility, and portability – but offers superior digital transferability and resistance to censorship. It’s increasingly seen as a modern store of value. Diversification Benefits Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional asset classes (stocks, bonds) makes it an attractive tool for portfolio diversification, potentially reducing overall risk while enhancing returns. Technological Innovation Institutions recognize the underlying blockchain technology as a groundbreaking innovation with potential to revolutionize various industries beyond finance, making Bitcoin an early-stage investment in this future. Growing Regulatory Clarity The emergence of clearer regulatory frameworks, particularly in major economies, has provided institutions with the confidence and legal certainty needed to engage with digital assets. Navigating the Bitcoin Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While Bitcoin’s ascent is undeniable, it’s crucial to acknowledge that the journey isn’t without its complexities. Like any investment, Bitcoin presents both significant opportunities and inherent challenges that investors must consider. Potential Challenges for Bitcoin Investors: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can be significant. While this volatility presents opportunities for gains, it also carries substantial risk of losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains evolving and fragmented across different jurisdictions, which can introduce uncertainty. Security Risks: While the Bitcoin network itself is highly secure, individual investors face risks related to secure storage (wallets), phishing attacks, and exchange hacks if proper precautions are not taken. Market Manipulation: The relatively nascent nature of the crypto market compared to traditional finance means it can be more susceptible to large-scale market manipulation. Unlocking Opportunities with Bitcoin: Despite the challenges, the opportunities Bitcoin offers are compelling: Asymmetric Upside: Many believe Bitcoin still has significant growth potential, offering a disproportionately high return relative to its current valuation compared to traditional assets. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a borderless asset, accessible to anyone with an internet connection, facilitating global transactions and financial inclusion. Inflation Protection: As highlighted by Pompliano, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it a strong candidate for protecting wealth against inflationary pressures. Technological Disruption: Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the broader blockchain technology, which is poised to disrupt numerous industries. Actionable Insights for Engaging with Bitcoin For those looking to understand or participate in the Bitcoin market, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing, thoroughly understand Bitcoin’s technology, economics, and market dynamics. Don’t rely solely on headlines or social media trends. Start Small and Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): Given Bitcoin’s volatility, consider investing a small, fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) rather than a large lump sum. This strategy helps mitigate risk over time. Secure Your Holdings: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings to enhance security against hacks and theft. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a high-risk, high-reward asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Follow reliable news sources, industry experts, and market analysis to stay updated on developments. The Enduring Reign of Bitcoin: A Compelling Future Anthony Pompliano’s bold assertion that Bitcoin is now ‘the king of Wall Street’ is more than just a catchy phrase; it’s a testament to a profound paradigm shift in global finance. The data, from the eroding purchasing power of the U.S. dollar to the stark underperformance of the S&P 500 when measured against Bitcoin, paints a clear picture of a digital asset that is not only holding its own but aggressively gaining ground against traditional financial stalwarts. The increasing institutional embrace, driven by Bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge, a diversifier, and a technological innovation, signals a future where digital assets play an ever more central role. While challenges remain, the opportunities presented by Bitcoin’s unique attributes continue to attract significant capital and attention, solidifying its position at the pinnacle of modern investment. As Wall Street increasingly bows to its new monarch, the reign of Bitcoin appears set to continue, reshaping the very foundations of wealth and value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does Anthony Pompliano mean by calling Bitcoin ‘the king of Wall Street’? Anthony Pompliano means that Bitcoin has surpassed traditional assets in terms of relevance, performance, and institutional adoption, becoming the most significant and influential asset for major financial players on Wall Street. He cites its superior returns compared to the S&P 500 and its ability to maintain purchasing power against the depreciating U.S. dollar. Q2: How has Bitcoin performed against the U.S. dollar and the S&P 500? According to Pompliano, the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power has declined by approximately 30% over the past five years. In contrast, the S&P 500 has dropped more than 85% when its performance is measured in Bitcoin since 2020, highlighting Bitcoin’s significant outperformance as an investment. Q3: Why are institutions increasingly embracing Bitcoin? Institutions are embracing Bitcoin for several reasons, including its potential as an inflation hedge due to its finite supply, its role as ‘digital gold’ for portfolio diversification, the increasing regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets, and the recognition of its underlying blockchain technology as a major innovation. Q4: What are the main risks associated with investing in Bitcoin? Key risks include high price volatility, ongoing regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions, security risks related to digital asset storage and exchanges, and the potential for market manipulation in a relatively nascent market. Q5: What is ‘Dollar-Cost Averaging’ (DCA) and why is it recommended for Bitcoin? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. It’s recommended for Bitcoin to mitigate the impact of its high volatility, as it averages out the purchase price over time and reduces the risk of buying at a single price peak.

Verisign, an internet infrastructure provider, announced Berkshire’s sale on Monday, noting the Omaha-based investment giant would sell 4,300,000 shares of the company’s common stock to the public for $285 per share . Verisign’s stock, VRSN, is down 3.78% in the past 24 hours and 7.61% in the past five days. The stock is still up 29% in 2025, however. The sell-off materialized after Buffett’s firm acquired multiple new stocks in the first quarter of 2025. Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year indicated Berkshire added 865,311 shares of the swimming pool supply giant POOLCORP (POOL) for nearly $262 million in Q1. The firm purchased an additional 6,384,676 shares of the alcohol producer Constellation Brands (STZ) for nearly $961 million, and it acquired 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) worth approximately $204 million. The Omaha-based holding company also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm. Those new shares were worth nearly $50 million in Q1. The performance of Berkshire’s new investments has been mixed in 2025 so far: POOL is down 8.42% on the year and STZ is down 22.42%, while DPZ is up 13.25% year-to-date and HEI is up 36.8%.

2025-07-31 09:14:42,49293214,1753953282,"Top undervalued penny coin this month, could 20x before BTC crosses $150K","Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, the protocol has raised over $13.7 million and attracted more than 14,700 holders. Only 7% of the 170 million tokens allocated in this round have been sold so far, signaling immense room for growth before the listing price of $0.06. For early-stage buyers, the pricing window remains extremely favorable in comparison to what’s expected post-launch. Demand-driven utility backing MUTM’s future price trajectory Unlike many speculative tokens with little more than hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to deliver concrete utility that directly feeds into price momentum. The protocol supports both peer-to-collector (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. Lenders can earn high APYs depending on pool utilization — for example, depositing 10,000 USDT could yield up to 12% APY, resulting in a passive income of 1,200 USDT annually. At the same time, borrowers can unlock liquidity by depositing blue-chip assets like Ethereum (ETH) with calculated loan-to-value (LTV) thresholds. A borrower depositing $5,000 worth of ETH at a 70% LTV can borrow up to $3,500 in stablecoins, without needing to sell their holdings. These real economic activities increase the usage of the protocol, leading to a rise in transaction volume, user base, and demand for its native token, MUTM. Each time users lend, borrow, or stake, they interact with smart contracts that loop value back into the system. That’s where the MUTM token plays a central role — it underpins governance, fee sharing, and rewards across the ecosystem. Adding to this strong base of demand is the upcoming beta launch, which is scheduled to go live before the listing. This beta release will introduce users to live platform functionality, enabling early community interaction, feedback, and improvement. As more users experience the real utility of the platform, visibility will grow, and with it, the desire to own a stake in the ecosystem before it becomes fully operational. Furthermore, Layer-2 integration is designed to make the entire user experience faster and cheaper by reducing gas fees. Lower fees remove friction for small lenders and borrowers, making it easier for the platform to scale rapidly, especially in regions where transaction costs are a barrier. More activity means higher utilization, which drives demand for the token powering that activity: MUTM. Tokenomics, beta, and staking: a recipe for supply squeeze The protocol’s design ensures that token demand grows organically over time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates on a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of revenue generated through platform usage is routed to purchase MUTM on the open market, then redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens in the designated smart contracts. This mechanism drives continuous buying pressure without relying on external hype or listing pumps. Staking also encourages long-term involvement with the platform. When users stake mtTokens — which represent deposited assets and accumulated yield — they gain additional MUTM rewards. This controls the circulating supply and locks up more tokens, increasing demand and supporting upward price movement. Combined with an initial listing price of $0.06, this setup creates a favorable environment for early participants. Investors who bought during Phase 1 at $0.01 have already seen a 250% gain. Even at $0.035 in Phase 6, entry remains significantly below projected post-listing prices. With the underlying utility, staking incentives, active development pipeline, and upcoming exchange listing in place, it is not unrealistic for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $0.70 or more — a 20x return — once broader market attention converges. As BTC inches closer to $150K, and altcoins surge in correlation, undervalued projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are likely to attract capital faster than ever. But unlike tokens that rely on pure market speculation, MUTM is building a user-centric ecosystem with real functionality, which is precisely what makes it more than just a penny coin. It’s a DeFi foundation in the making.

2025-07-31 09:10:11,49291070,1753953011,Phoenix Group Unveils Impressive Bitcoin Holdings Growth in Q2,"BitcoinWorld Phoenix Group Unveils Impressive Bitcoin Holdings Growth in Q2 In the dynamic world of digital assets, institutional adoption continues to be a pivotal driver, signaling a maturing market. Dubai-based Phoenix Group, a prominent name in crypto mining equipment distribution, recently made headlines with a significant expansion of its Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter. This strategic move not only solidified their position as a major player but also highlighted a growing trend among corporations to formalize substantial digital asset treasury strategies. What does this mean for the crypto landscape, and why are companies like Phoenix Group increasingly betting big on assets like Bitcoin and Solana? Phoenix Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Expansion – A Powerful Statement Phoenix Group’s latest announcement isn’t just a mere statistic; it’s a powerful testament to a meticulously crafted financial strategy. According to a Business Wire press release, the company formalized a staggering $150 million digital asset treasury strategy, signaling a profound, long-term commitment to the crypto space. In Q2 alone, they acquired an impressive 179 Bitcoin, propelling their total Bitcoin holdings to a remarkable 514 BTC. This substantial acquisition places them among a growing cohort of public and private companies embracing digital assets as a core component of their balance sheets. Crucially, their digital asset portfolio extends beyond just Bitcoin; they also hold over 630,000 SOL, showcasing a diversified and forward-thinking approach to their digital treasury. The formalization of this $150 million strategy moves beyond speculative trading. It indicates a structured, long-term investment philosophy, integrating digital assets into their core financial operations. For a company primarily known as a leading distributor of crypto mining equipment, this strategic pivot into direct asset ownership creates a synergistic ecosystem. It allows them to not only facilitate mining operations globally but also directly participate in the appreciation of the very assets their equipment helps to secure. This dual approach could provide a robust hedge against market fluctuations, ensuring profitability across different facets of the crypto economy and sending a strong signal to the market about the company’s confidence in the enduring value and future growth of digital currencies. Why are Bitcoin Holdings Becoming a Corporate Imperative? The decision by companies like Phoenix Group to accumulate significant Bitcoin holdings isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader, evolving corporate treasury management landscape. For years, traditional corporate treasuries focused primarily on cash, bonds, and other low-yield, stable assets. However, with persistent inflation concerns, negative real interest rates in many traditional markets, and a global search for alternative stores of value, Bitcoin has emerged as a compelling option. What precisely drives this profound shift in corporate financial strategy? Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s strictly limited supply of 21 million coins positions it as a robust hedge against the inflationary pressures eroding fiat currency purchasing power. Companies view it as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset designed to retain value over time. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated unparalleled long-term growth potential. Corporations are increasingly willing to accept short-term price swings for the prospect of significant capital appreciation. Diversification Benefits: Adding cryptocurrencies to a traditional portfolio can offer diversification benefits. Bitcoin’s often low correlation with traditional asset classes can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns, especially during economic uncertainty. Technological Alignment: Investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets aligns companies with cutting-edge technology and the burgeoning digital economy. It signals innovation and adaptability to stakeholders. First-Mover Advantage: While institutional adoption is accelerating, early movers can establish themselves as leaders in the evolving digital financial landscape. Liquidity and Accessibility: Bitcoin is highly liquid, with a global 24/7 market, making it easy to buy and sell. Maturing infrastructure for institutional access, including secure custody solutions, has reduced operational hurdles. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a successful model for integrating digital assets into corporate finance. Tesla also made headlines with its significant BTC purchases, further legitimizing the asset class in corporate boardrooms. Beyond Bitcoin: Diversifying Digital Asset Holdings with Solana’s Strategic Role While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines as the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies and a store of value, Phoenix Group’s substantial holding of over 630,000 SOL highlights another crucial aspect of their digital asset strategy: intelligent diversification. Solana (SOL) represents a different facet of the crypto ecosystem – a high-performance, permissionless blockchain designed for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and scalable solutions. It aims to compete with Ethereum by offering significantly higher transaction speeds and lower fees. What does the strategic inclusion of Solana signify for Phoenix Group’s overall treasury management and their vision for the future? Ecosystem Growth and Utility: Investing in a thriving smart contract platform like Solana positions Phoenix Group to benefit from the explosive growth of Web3, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and other innovative applications built on its network. SOL isn’t just a store of value; it’s a utility token that powers a vast and rapidly expanding digital economy. High Throughput and Scalability: Solana’s ability to process tens of thousands of transactions per second offers a distinct value proposition compared to Bitcoin’s primary role as ‘digital gold.’ This investment reflects a belief in the future of scalable blockchain infrastructure. Strategic Hedging: While Bitcoin provides a hedge against traditional financial systems, Solana offers a hedge within the crypto space itself. It diversifies exposure beyond a single asset class (store of value) into the realm of programmable money and decentralized computing, mitigating risks associated with potential shifts in market dominance or technological paradigms. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Holding SOL demonstrates a commitment to innovation and a recognition of the multifaceted nature of the crypto market. It’s an investment in the foundational technology that could power the next generation of the internet. This dual-asset approach showcases a sophisticated understanding of the crypto market, leveraging Bitcoin for its established store-of-value properties and Solana for its growth potential within the dApp ecosystem. It’s a strategic move that balances stability with innovation. The Road Ahead: Future Implications for Phoenix Group’s Bitcoin Holdings With a formalized $150 million digital asset treasury strategy and growing Bitcoin holdings , Phoenix Group is clearly signaling a robust, long-term commitment to the crypto space. Their actions set a precedent for other corporations, particularly those operating in the burgeoning digital economy. What might the future hold for their strategy, and what broader implications does this have for institutional adoption? Continued Accumulation: It’s highly plausible that Phoenix Group will continue to accumulate digital assets, potentially employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate volatility and build their positions over time. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Dubai, where Phoenix Group is based, has positioned itself as a progressive hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. Its clear regulatory frameworks, such as those established by the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), provide a conducive environment for businesses to operate and hold digital assets. This supportive regulatory climate could further embolden Phoenix Group and attract more companies. Volatility Management: While benefits are clear, managing volatility remains key. Phoenix Group likely employs sophisticated risk management strategies, which could include hedging instruments or maintaining a long-term ‘HODL’ philosophy. Impact on Traditional Finance: Phoenix Group’s transparent and formalized approach could serve as a blueprint, encouraging more traditional companies to explore similar digital asset treasury strategies. As more corporations follow suit, it could lead to increased stability and liquidity for the crypto space. Increased Transparency: The public disclosure of their holdings sets a valuable precedent for transparency in corporate crypto treasuries. As the industry matures, we can expect more companies to provide clear insights into their digital asset strategies. Phoenix Group’s proactive stance in accumulating significant digital assets underscores a strategic vision that looks beyond immediate market fluctuations. It’s a clear signal that cryptocurrencies are becoming an integral part of sophisticated corporate financial planning. Phoenix Group’s strategic decision to significantly boost its Bitcoin holdings and formalize a robust digital asset treasury strategy marks a pivotal moment for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market. Their impressive portfolio of 514 BTC and over 630,000 SOL not only underscores a strong belief in the long-term value of digital assets but also highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. As the lines between traditional finance and the digital economy continue to blur, Phoenix Group stands out as a prime example of how businesses are strategically embracing cryptocurrencies to diversify, innovate, and secure their financial future. This move serves as a powerful indicator of the increasing maturity and institutional confidence in the crypto space, paving the way for further adoption and integration into global financial frameworks. Their transparency and proactive investment strategy offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of corporate finance in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Phoenix Group’s core business?

CFTC becomes the main gatekeeper deciding which assets get futures trading. No market cap, liquidity, or float requirements exist under the current framework. The SEC has effectively transferred crypto ETF approval authority to the CFTC by establishing futures contracts as the primary qualification standard for digital asset exchange-traded products. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart described this arrangement as “pseudo-outsourcing” decision-making power to the derivatives regulator. Under the proposed listing standards, cryptocurrencies need only show six months of futures trading on the Coinbase derivatives exchange to qualify for ETF inclusion. This framework removes traditional investment product requirements and places the CFTC in control of which assets can access ETF structures. If the rule is finalized as-is, the SEC pseudo outsourced the decision making for which digital assets will be allowed in an ETF wrapper. The CFTC is the primary decider of what asset can have futures contracts & having futures is the primary requirement of this rule proposal https://t.co/PVFfUKvu… The post SEC Pseudo-Outsources Crypto ETF Decisions to CFTC Through Futures Rule appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|ETFs News|SEC,EN,0,sec make future contract primary requirement crypto etf approval cftc becomes main gatekeeper deciding asset get future trading market cap liquidity float requirement exist current framework sec effectively transferred crypto etf approval authority cftc establishing future contract primary qualification standard digital asset product bloomberg analyst james seyffart described arrangement power derivative regulator proposed listing standard cryptocurrencies need show six month future trading coinbase derivative exchange qualify etf inclusion framework remove traditional investment product requirement place cftc control asset access etf structure rule finalized sec pseudo outsourced decision making digital asset allowed etf wrapper cftc primary decider asset future contract future primary requirement rule proposal http post sec crypto etf decision cftc future rule appeared first coin edition,0.0,0.808,0.192,0.9698,1
2025-07-31 09:06:59,49293212,1753952819,Bitcoin whales back this presale before it races past Solana and TRON,"But what’s driving this rapid shift in attention toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Beyond its early-stage value, the platform brings real-world utility, audited smart contracts, and a fast-approaching beta launch that’s sparking strong demand among crypto veterans. Early investors eye massive ROI as buybacks strengthen Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is now live, with 7% of the 170 million token allocation already sold and over $13.7 million raised so far. As the project moves into Phase 7, the price will climb by 15%—from $0.035 to $0.040—marking the sharpest increase yet. And with the presale culminating at $0.06, buyers at the current price are positioned for a strong short-term return. Those who secured tokens at $0.01 in Phase 1 are already up 250%. By the time listing occurs at $0.06, that ROI climbs to 500%. With post-listing projections exceeding $0.15, early buyers will lock in a 1400% return. Even current Phase 6 participants stand to nearly double their investment before the token reaches its initial exchange price—and triple it shortly after. This trajectory is supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of revenue from lending and borrowing is continually used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens are distributed to mtToken stakers in the designated smart contracts, rewarding long-term participation and creating continuous buy pressure. As platform activity increases, this loop strengthens, reinforcing both token stability and price appreciation. Real-world lending utility attracts long-term users Unlike many presale tokens built on hype alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to introduce an actual working model. It operates through two distinct lending systems—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will be able to lend their assets into smart contract pools and earn stable, protocol-set interest rates. For example, a lender depositing USDT or USDC can expect to earn over 10% APY based on current pool utilization. Borrowers can access these funds by locking collateral based on specific LTV ratios. A user depositing $5,000 worth of ETH at an 80% LTV, for instance, could instantly borrow $4,000 in stablecoins, without selling their ETH exposure. This frictionless model creates value for both parties: passive returns for lenders and efficient liquidity for borrowers. Meanwhile, the P2P structure includes high-risk and memcoin tokens and allows users to negotiate directly with each other, offering more flexible rates, terms, and token support for those seeking personalized agreements. The decentralized stablecoin launch will further boost utility. This stablecoin will only be minted when loans are issued and burned when they’re repaid, ensuring controlled issuance and zero inflation. And with Layer-2 integration planned, users will benefit from near-zero gas fees and high transaction speeds. Beta launch and investor incentives drive rapid adoption To prepare for the mainnet, the team is launching a beta version of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform at the time of its official listing. This early access will give users a chance to test the lending, borrowing, and staking functionalities in a controlled environment, raising anticipation and attracting more presale buyers as word spreads. Security is also being taken seriously. A comprehensive CertiK audit has already been conducted, achieving a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 78.00. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty program is running to ensure platform integrity. Community engagement is growing fast, with over 12,000 Twitter followers, and a $100,000 giveaway campaign is rewarding early supporters—ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now widely seen as the next breakout altcoin for investors seeking a high-utility project with a solid entry price and strong upside. With token buybacks, revenue-sharing, audited smart contracts, and active presale momentum, this is the project that Bitcoin (BTC) whales are betting on now—before it races past Solana (SOL) and TRON (TRX) in the coming cycles.

2025-07-31 09:05:38,49293258,1753952738,Rice Robotics to Debut RICE Token for AI Data Marketplace on TokenFi Launchpad,"Rice Robotics, the company behind the RICE AI platform, said it will start selling its RICE token on Aug. 5 via the TokenFi Launchpad. RICE will power a decentralized data marketplace for AI-powered robots, which is part of a broader effort to tokenize robotics data and scale decentralized physical infrastructure, or DePIN, the Hong Kong-based company said in a release. The $750,000 presale represents 10% of the total 1 billion token supply, with a valuation of $7.5 million. Launch partners include BNB Chain, DWF Labs, and Floki, a memecoin ecosystem with over 700,000 holders and its own tokenization platform, TokenFi. Rice Robotics is known for its indoor autonomous delivery robots, which are deployed at Softbank’s Tokyo headquarters, Mitsui Fudosan’s Tokyo Midtown Yaesu property and 7-Eleven Japan stores, where they integrate with the 7-Now delivery app. The company is part of the Nvidia Inception program and was selected for MVB Season 10, an accelerator co-hosted by BNB Chain, CoinMarketCap Labs and YziLabs. In April, Rice Robotics and Floki announced the introduction of the Floki-branded Minibot M1 , an AI-powered consumer robot that runs on the RICE AI platform. 800 Minibot units sold out in a 24-hour presale held in May, CoinDesk reported. Owners will be eligible for a RICE airdrop at token generation. The token will underpin Rice’s decentralized robotics foundry, where companies and individuals can contribute real-world robotics data and receive token rewards. That data is sold to companies or labs needing specialized training sets. In-house foundation models trained on this data will be offered on a subscription basis, with discounts for payments in RICE. The token will also serve as a governance asset and incorporate a deflationary mechanism via token burns funded by platform fees. Earlier this year, the company raised $7 million in pre-Series A funding from investors including the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, Soul Capital, Audacy Ventures, Sun Hung Kai & Co., and Cyberport HK. It also won top honors at a BNB Demo Day event in Dubai, where Binance founder CZ was a judge.",Finance|Real World Assets|Floki|AI|robotics|News,EN,1,rice robotics company behind rice ai platform said start selling rice token via tokenfi launchpad rice power decentralized data marketplace robot part broader effort tokenize robotics data scale decentralized physical infrastructure depin hong company said release presale represents total billion token supply valuation million launch partner include bnb chain dwf lab floki memecoin ecosystem holder tokenization platform tokenfi rice robotics known indoor autonomous delivery robot deployed softbank tokyo headquarters mitsui fudosan tokyo midtown yaesu property japan store integrate delivery app company part nvidia inception program selected mvb season accelerator bnb chain coinmarketcap lab yzilabs april rice robotics floki announced introduction minibot consumer robot run rice ai platform minibot unit sold presale held may coindesk reported owner eligible rice airdrop token generation token underpin rice decentralized robotics foundry company individual contribute robotics data receive token reward data sold company lab needing specialized training set foundation model trained data offered subscription basis discount payment rice token also serve governance asset incorporate deflationary mechanism via token burn funded platform fee earlier year company raised million funding investor including alibaba entrepreneur fund soul capital audacy venture sun hung kai cyberport hk also top honor bnb demo day event dubai binance founder cz judge,0.0,0.935,0.065,0.91,1

The San Francisco, California-based exchange reported adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $79.7 million, compared to $85.5 million in Q2 2024. This was also a 57% drop from its EBITDA of $187.4 million in Q1. Kraken pointed out that ""Q2 tends to be a seasonally lower quarter for trading activity across the industry,"" in an earnings statement on Thursday . The exchange also highlighted market turbulence related to the imposing of steeper tariffs by President Trump on trade with the U.S. This brought about a significant slide in the crypto market, with BTC falling to a 2025 low of around $76,000 in early April. Kraken saw revenue fall 13% to $411.6 million compared to $471.7 million in Q1, though this was an 18% increase on Q2 2024. One of Kraken's rivals Robinhood (HOOD) published its Q2 earnings on Wednesday, revealing a year-over-year jump of 98% in crypto revenue from the much lower base of $81 million up to $160 million. Robinhood's crypto trading volume of $28.3 billion is dwarfed by that of Kraken which was $186.6 billion in the quarter.

2025-07-31 09:03:38,49293209,1753952618,Missed MATIC’s early gains? MUTM at $0.035 might be the next play to watch,"Even at the current Phase 6 entry point, a 70 to 100% increase can be seen by the time the token lists, with momentum building for 200–300% gains shortly after. Those who missed early entry on Polygon (MATIC) now have a real second chance to engage with a protocol still in its development stage but already proving its investor appeal—over $13.7 million has already been raised, and 7% of Phase 6’s 170 million tokens are gone. Decentralized lending that drives price utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate on a dual lending model—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—each designed to drive continuous protocol activity and fuel long-term demand for MUTM tokens. In the P2C model, lenders will earn passive income through dynamic APYs that adjust based on pool utilization. For example, depositing SOL into the protocol will yield returns as high as 8.5% APY, offering users a reliable income stream backed by real borrower demand. On the flip side, borrowers will be able to unlock liquidity by locking in blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, or USDC and borrowing up to 70% of their value. A borrower who locks $10,000 worth of ETH will access $7,000 in stablecoins, without having to sell their underlying asset. As lending volume grows and borrowing activity surges, pool utilization will rise, pushing interest rates higher and boosting earnings for depositors. This system will encourage users to acquire mtTokens, which represent deposit positions and accumulate yield. The increased demand for mtTokens will act as a key driver of MUTM’s price growth, creating a powerful feedback loop tied directly to platform usage. The P2P model will offer additional flexibility by enabling custom loan terms between users. This setup will allow for higher-risk, higher-reward lending strategies involving less liquid or uniquely positioned tokens. As both P2C and P2P models gain traction, they will feed revenue into the protocol’s ecosystem, fueling the automated buyback mechanisms that manage supply and further strengthen MUTM’s tokenomics. Beta launch, buybacks, and a locked-in supply strategy The upcoming Beta platform launch is a critical step for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It will allow users to experience the lending and borrowing system firsthand when the token is listed. This early interaction will drive awareness, build long-term user habits, and increase transaction volume across pools, directly influencing the utility of mtTokens and the price of MUTM. One of the strongest features supporting MUTM’s price is the buyback model built into the protocol. A portion of protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM off the open market, which is then distributed to users staking mtTokens in the smart contracts. This strategy creates a continuous upward pressure on price as platform activity grows. Unlike hype-driven tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ties token demand directly to platform usage, reinforcing sustainable growth. With only 4 billion tokens in total supply and 170 million allocated for Phase 6, supply remains tightly managed. As demand scales from lending volume, collateral usage, and staking, this scarcity becomes a major catalyst for price growth. Audit and $100K giveaway The platform is also backed by strong trust signals—an ongoing $50,000 CertiK bug bounty has been launched alongside completed manual reviews and a 95/100 Token Scan score. These steps confirm that the team is prioritizing security before mainnet deployment. The $100,000 giveaway campaign, with ten winners receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM each, is actively building community engagement, which now exceeds 12,000 followers on Twitter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only building to address the need for secure, flexible lending and borrowing in DeFi—it is building to anchor token price performance to protocol utility and actual user activity. With a 15% price jump coming in Phase 7, the window for maximum returns is narrowing quickly. Investors who missed early runs like MATIC at $0.01 now have another opportunity to make their early move—this time, with fundamentals and tokenomics aligned for sustainable growth.

2025-07-31 09:02:07,49290748,1753952527,"SEC Sets New Crypto ETF Standards, Dozen Major Tokens Could Qualify by October","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has established new listing standards for cryptocurrency exchange-traded products that could clear the path for approximately a dozen major digital assets to gain ETF approval by October. The CBOE filing reveals that any cryptocurrency with futures contracts trading on designated markets for at least six months would automatically qualify for ETP listing under the new Generic Listing Standards framework. The new rule allows an issuer's shares to be listed on an exchange if the underlying commodity to which exposure is given has a contract on a Designated Contract Market for at least 6 months. pic.twitter.com/zd5rDdCxPg — Greg Xethalis (@xethalis) July 30, 2025 CFTC Becomes Crypto ETF Gatekeeper as SEC Shifts Approval Authority The breakthrough comes after months of regulatory uncertainty that saw the SEC both approve and immediately reverse decisions on multi-asset crypto ETFs. Eric Balchunas noted that the eligible tokens include “ the usual suspects ” that previously held 85% or higher approval odds, with September and October emerging as the likely approval timeline for pending applications. The SEC's ""Listing Standards"" for crypto ETPs is out via new exchange filing. BOTTOM LINE: Any coin that has futures tracking it for >6mo on Coinbase's derivatives exchange would be approved (below is list). It's about a dozen of the usual suspects, the same ones we had at 85% or… https://t.co/QlzZnta7Yv pic.twitter.com/CmBr8XxAcM — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 30, 2025 The new standards effectively outsource ETF approval decisions to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees futures market designations. The framework requires no specific market capitalization, underlying liquidity, or float percentage requirements, only the existence of qualifying futures contracts. Among the eligible cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , XRP , Cardano , Avalanche , Chainlink , Litecoin, Polkadot, Dogecoin , Stellar, and Shiba Inu. Solana ETPs face an October 10 approval deadline, with XRP following shortly after as their respective futures contracts reach the six-month threshold. The developments build on significant momentum in the crypto ETF space. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $55.11 billion in cumulative inflows with $151.36 billion in assets under management. Source: SosoValue Ethereum ETFs reached $21.5 billion in assets, representing 4.7% of Ethereum’s market capitalization, following 19 consecutive days of net inflows totaling over $9 billion. Regulatory Framework Streamlines Approval Process The CBOE’s Generic Listing Standards filing eliminates the traditional 19b-4 rule change process that previously required individual exchange applications for each crypto ETP. Under the new framework, qualifying products could receive approval after a 75-day review period, dramatically reducing time-to-market for issuers. The SEC voted on July 29 to approve in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for crypto ETPs, allowing authorized participants to exchange shares for underlying cryptocurrencies rather than cash. The SEC has approved in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin and Ether ETPs, a decision expected to boost efficiency and lower costs in the crypto ETF market. #SEC #CryptoETP https://t.co/lJoF4WXJaG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Chairman Paul Atkins emphasized the change would make products “ less costly and more efficient ” for investors. The in-kind redemption model provides significant tax advantages for institutional investors by allowing them to defer capital gains until they choose to sell the received cryptocurrencies. Previously, cash-only redemptions forced ETF issuers to sell underlying assets, triggering immediate tax consequences for shareholders. The Commission also approved applications for mixed Bitcoin-Ethereum ETPs and expanded position limits for Bitcoin ETP options to 250,000 contracts. Two scheduling orders were issued seeking public comment on large-cap crypto ETP listings previously approved under delegated authority. Greg Xethalis identified September 17 as a critical date, marking six months after Solana futures launched on CME. Circle September 17 as the date that is 6 months after SOL Futures listed on CME, although they were certified ~ one month sooner on Bitnomial and NADEX (so that could mean earlier approval if GLS is live or if the SEC acts independently on Solana 19b4s). — Greg Xethalis (@xethalis) July 30, 2025 However, earlier certification on Bitnomial and NADEX could accelerate approval timelines if the Generic Listing Standards receive final approval or if the SEC acts independently on pending applications. Market Dynamics Signal Institutional Adoption Surge Institutional demand has accelerated despite ongoing regulatory developments. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded $147.36 million in inflows on July 28 , leading spot Bitcoin ETFs to $157 million in total daily inflows. Ethereum ETFs attracted $65.14 million the same day, with BlackRock’s ETHA contributing $131.95 million. Corporate treasury adoption has expanded beyond Bitcoin. SharpLink Gaming became the largest corporate holder of Ethereum with 280,706 ETH worth approximately $840 million, surpassing the Ethereum Foundation. Corporate treasuries purchased at least $1.6 billion worth of ETH in recent weeks, with companies actively participating in network staking for yield generation.

Bloomberg Intelligence assigns 95% approval odds for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs before year-end. Notably, recent volatility included the SEC’s controversial approval and immediate reversal of Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index ETF on July 22. The fund would have tracked ten digital assets with 85% allocation to previously approved components like Bitcoin and Ethereum before Assistant Secretary Sherry Haywood issued a stay order under Rule 431.

2025-07-31 09:00:55,49290590,1753952455,"JPMorgan, Coinbase Forge Historic Pact For Direct Bank-Crypto Wallet Integration By 2026","JPMorgan Chase and crypto exchange Coinbase have announced a new partnership on Wednesday that marks a pivotal shift in the relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. As the crypto industry experiences a bullish resurgence, fueled by a more favorable regulatory environment in the United States, major financial institutions are reassessing their earlier skepticism toward digital currencies and are now eager to explore the opportunities within this sector. JPMorgan’s Collaboration With Coinbase The recent passage of key legislation—the GENIUS Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and anti-Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) bills—through Congress has encouraged more banks and firms to consider integrating digital assets into their operations. Related Reading: XRP, Dogecoin, And Shiba Inu Get Major Boost From Gemini Exchange Announcement This renewed interest comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market has reached an impressive valuation of approximately $4 trillion, with expectations for continued growth as regulatory clarity emerges in major markets. Starting in 2026, JPMorgan customers will be able to fund their Coinbase wallets using Chase credit cards, according to Reuters, therefore facilitating easier access to cryptocurrency purchases. The partnership also allows Chase customers to redeem credit card reward points for Circle’s USDC stablecoin. This feature, alongside the ability to link bank accounts directly to Coinbase for funding crypto purchases, reflects the increasing integration of digital assets into everyday financial transactions. Financial Giants Step Into The Crypto Market Stablecoins, which are designed to minimize price volatility, are positioned as essential tools for facilitating seamless transactions in both trading and payments. They are now under a new regulatory framework established by the GENIUS Act, which was signed by President Donald Trump. Market analysts have noted that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is set to accelerate in light of the recent legislative changes. BCA Research highlighted that companies within the crypto ecosystem are well-positioned to benefit from this growth, suggesting that increased adoption will lead to price appreciation for digital assets.
